"Overview - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. It's most commonly used to treat anxiety and depression , but can be useful for other mental and physical health problems. How CBT works. CBT is based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a negative cycle. CBT aims to help you deal with overwhelming problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts. You're shown how to change these negative patterns to improve the way you feel. Unlike some other talking treatments, CBT deals with your current problems, rather than focusing on issues from your past. It looks for practical ways to improve your state of mind on a daily basis. Uses for CBT. CBT has been shown to be an effective way of treating a number of different mental health conditions. In addition to depression or anxiety disorders, CBT can also help people with: bipolar disorder. borderline personality disorder. eating disorders – such as anorexia and bulimia. obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). panic disorder. phobias. post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). psychosis. schizophrenia. sleep problems – such as insomnia. problems related to alcohol misuse. CBT is also sometimes used to treat people with long-term health conditions, such as: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). fibromyalgia. chronic pain. Although CBT cannot cure the physical symptoms of these conditions, it can help people cope better with their symptoms. What happens during CBT sessions. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 6 and 20 sessions, with each session lasting 30 to 60 minutes. During the sessions, you'll work with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts, such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions. You and your therapist will analyse these areas to work out if they're unrealistic or unhelpful, and to determine the effect they have on each other and on you. Your therapist will then be able to help you work out how to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours. After working out what you can change, your therapist will ask you to practise these changes in your daily life and you'll discuss how you got on during the next session. The eventual aim of therapy is to teach you to apply the skills you have learnt during treatment to your daily life. This should help you manage your problems and stop them having a negative impact on your life, even after your course of treatment finishes. Pros and cons of CBT. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in treating some mental health problems, but it may not be successful or suitable for everyone. Some of the advantages of CBT include: it can be completed in a relatively short period of time compared with other talking therapies. the highly structured nature of CBT means it can be provided in different formats, including in groups, self-help books and online. it teaches you useful and practical strategies that can be used in everyday life, even after the treatment has finished. it focuses on the person's capacity to change themselves (their thoughts, feelings and behaviours). it can be as effective as medicine in treating some mental health problems and may be helpful in cases where medicine alone has not worked. Some of the disadvantages of CBT to consider include: you need to commit yourself to the process to get the most from it – a therapist can help and advise you, but they need your co-operation. attending regular CBT sessions and carrying out any extra work between sessions can take up a lot of your time. it may not be suitable for people with more complex mental health needs or learning difficulties. it involves confronting your emotions and anxieties – you may experience initial periods where you're anxious or emotionally uncomfortable. it does not address any wider problems in systems or families that may have a significant impact on someone's health and wellbeing. Some critics also argue that while CBT addresses current problems and focuses on specific issues, it does not address the possible underlying causes of mental health conditions, such as an unhappy childhood. How to find a CBT therapist. You can get talking therapies, including CBT, on the NHS. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Find an NHS talking therapies service Or your GP can refer you if you prefer.

You may start to avoid certain situations because you fear they'll trigger another attack. This can create a cycle of living ""in fear of fear"". It can add to your sense of panic and may cause you to have more attacks. Panic attacks. During a panic attack you get a rush of intense mental and physical symptoms. It can come on very quickly and for no apparent reason. A panic attack can be very frightening and distressing. Symptoms include: a racing heartbeat. feeling faint. sweating. nausea. chest pain. shortness of breath. trembling. hot flushes. chills. shaky limbs. a choking sensation. dizziness. numbness or pins and needles. dry mouth. a feeling of dread or a fear of dying. a churning stomach. a tingling in your fingers. feeling like you're not connected to your body. Most panic attacks last between 5 and 20 minutes. Some have been reported to last up to an hour. The number of attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week. Although panic attacks are frightening, they're not dangerous. An attack will not cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely you'll be admitted to hospital if you have one. Be aware that most of these symptoms can also be symptoms of other conditions or problems, so you may not always be experiencing a panic attack. For example, you may have a racing heartbeat if you have very low blood pressure. When to get help. See a GP if you've been experiencing symptoms of panic disorder. They'll ask you to describe your symptoms, how often you get them, and how long you have had them. They may also carry out a physical examination to rule out other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you have regular and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least a month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks. Treatments for panic disorder. Treatment aims to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease your symptoms. Talking therapies and medicine are the main treatments for panic disorder. Your treatment will depend on your symptoms. Talking therapies. You can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service for treatment based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) .

You may need to see your GP regularly while you're having CBT so they can assess your progress. Medicine. If you and your doctor think it might be helpful, you may be prescribed: a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or, if SSRIs are not suitable, a tricyclic antidepressant (usually imipramine or clomipramine). an anti-epilepsy medicine such as pregabalin or, if your anxiety is severe, clonazepam (these medicines are also beneficial for treating anxiety). Antidepressants can take 2 to 4 weeks before they start to work, and up to 8 weeks to work fully. Keep taking your medicines, even if you feel they're not working, and only stop taking them if your GP advises you to do so. Referral to a specialist.

The law requires you to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could impact your driving ability. Visit GOV.UK for further information about driving with a disability or health condition . Causes. As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder is not fully understood. But it's thought to be linked to a combination of things, including: a traumatic or very stressful life experience, such as bereavement. having a close family member with panic disorder. an imbalance of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain. Panic disorder in children. If your child has the signs and symptoms of panic disorder, they should see a GP.

Work smarter, not harder. Working smarter means prioritising your work, concentrating on the tasks that'll make a real difference. Leave the least important tasks to last. Accept that you will not have time for everything. Try to be positive. Look for the positives in life, and things for which you're grateful. Try writing down 3 things that went well, or for which you're grateful, at the end of every day. Accept the things you can't change. Changing a difficult situation isn't always possible. Try to concentrate on the things you do have control over. For example, if your company is making redundancies, you could focus on the things that you can control, such as looking for a new job."

"Children and bereavement. The following information could help if your child has lost or is about to lose someone, such as a family member or friend. If your child is about to lose someone. If a child has a loved one, such as a friend or family member who's going to die, they can benefit from special support. A child's stress level is often at its highest before bereavement because of fear and the unknown. Pre-bereavement counselling gives a child a chance to think and talk about their feelings and share their worries. Making a memory box. If you're a parent and you know you're going to die, you could make a memory box to give to your child, or make one together. A memory box contains things that remind you both of your time together. It can provide an important link between you and your child once you've gone. If a child has lost someone. Talk about the person who has died. During bereavement, it can help a child to talk about the person who's died, whether it was a grandparent, parent, brother, sister or friend. Direct, honest and open communication is more helpful than trying to protect your child by hiding the truth. If you exclude them from family ceremonies and services after someone has died it could make them feel excluded. This can also help your child be open about their own feelings and avoid confusion about what has happened. It may be helpful to talk as a family, perhaps with your child, about how to include them in any events that celebrate or say goodbye to the person who has died. It's important for them to have someone with whom they can talk about that person and share their emotions. This could be through photos, games, memory boxes or stories. Over time, children may start to talk more about their loss at different times and in different ways. Young children may start talking about death or including it in their play, but this is normal and is a way for them to make sense of what has happened. Further support for your child.

"Grief after bereavement or loss. Most people experience grief when they lose something or someone important to them. If these feelings are affecting your life, there are things you can try that may help. Support is also available if you're finding it hard to cope with stress, anxiety or depression. Symptoms of bereavement, grief and loss. Bereavement, grief and loss can cause many different symptoms and they affect people in different ways. There's no right or wrong way to feel. As well as bereavement, there are other types of loss such as the end of a relationship or losing a job or home. Some of the most common symptoms include: shock and numbness – this is usually the first reaction to loss, and people often talk about ""being in a daze"". overwhelming sadness, with lots of crying. tiredness or exhaustion. anger – towards the person you've lost or the reason for your loss. guilt – for example, guilt about feeling angry, about something you said or did not say, or not being able to stop your loved one dying. These feelings may not be there all the time and powerful feelings may appear unexpectedly. It's not always easy to recognise when bereavement, grief or loss are the reason you're acting or feeling differently. Stages of bereavement or grief Some research suggests that there are 5 stages of bereavement or grief: Denial – feelings of shock, disbelief, panic or confusion. Anger – feelings and behaviours such as blaming yourself or blaming others. Depression – feeling tired, hopeless or helpless – like you have lost perspective or feel isolated. Bargaining – feelings of guilt often raise questions like ""If only I had done more"". Acceptance – this does not mean that you like the situation, it’s about accepting your loss and being ready to move forward. These are the most common stages of grief, but you may not experience them all.

"Raising low self-esteem. We all have times when we lack confidence and do not feel good about ourselves. But when low self-esteem becomes a long-term problem, it can have a harmful effect on our mental health and our day-to-day lives. What is self-esteem? Self-esteem is the opinion we have of ourselves. When we have healthy self-esteem, we tend to feel positive about ourselves and about life in general. It makes us better able to deal with life's ups and downs. When our self-esteem is low, we tend to see ourselves and our life in a more negative and critical light. We also feel less able to take on the challenges that life throws at us. What causes low self-esteem? Low self-esteem often begins in childhood. Our teachers, friends, siblings, parents, and even the media send us positive and negative messages about ourselves. For some reason, the message that you are not good enough is the one that stays with you. Perhaps you found it difficult to live up to other people's expectations of you, or to your own expectations. Stress and difficult life events, such as serious illness or a bereavement , can have a negative effect on self-esteem. Personality can also play a part. Some people are just more prone to negative thinking, while others set impossibly high standards for themselves. How does low self-esteem affect us? If you have low self-esteem or confidence, you may hide yourself away from social situations, stop trying new things, and avoid things you find challenging. In the short term, avoiding challenging and difficult situations might make you feel safe. In the longer term, this can backfire because it reinforces your underlying doubts and fears. It teaches you the unhelpful rule that the only way to cope is by avoiding things. Living with low self-esteem can harm your mental health and lead to problems such as depression and anxiety . You may also develop unhelpful habits, such as smoking and drinking too much, as a way of coping. How to have healthy self-esteem. To boost your self-esteem, you need to identify the negative beliefs you have about yourself, then challenge them. You may tell yourself you're ""too stupid"" to apply for a new job, for example, or that ""nobody cares"" about you. Start to note these negative thoughts and write them on a piece of paper or in a diary. Ask yourself when you first started to think these thoughts. Next, start to write some evidence that challenges these negative beliefs, such as, ""I'm really good at cryptic crosswords"" or ""My sister calls for a chat every week"". Write down other positive things about yourself, such as ""I'm thoughtful"" or ""I'm a great cook"" or ""I'm someone that others trust"". Also write some good things that other people say about you. Aim to have at least 5 positive things on your list and add to it regularly. Then put your list somewhere you can see it. That way, you can keep reminding yourself that you're OK. You might have low confidence now because of what happened when you were growing up, but we can grow and develop new ways of seeing ourselves at any age. Other ways to improve low self-esteem. Here are some other simple techniques that may help you feel better about yourself. Recognise what you're good at. We're all good at something, whether it's cooking, singing, doing puzzles or being a friend. We also tend to enjoy doing the things we're good at, which can help boost your mood. Build positive relationships. If you find certain people tend to bring you down, try to spend less time with them, or tell them how you feel about their words or actions. Try to build relationships with people who are positive and who appreciate you. Be kind to yourself. Being kind to yourself means being gentle to yourself at times when you feel like being self-critical. Think what you'd say to a friend in a similar situation. We often give far better advice to others than we do to ourselves. Learn to be assertive. Being assertive is about respecting other people's opinions and needs, and expecting the same from them. One trick is to look at other people who act assertively and copy what they do. It's not about pretending you're someone you're not. It's picking up hints and tips from people you admire and letting the real you come out. Start saying ""no"". People with low self-esteem often feel they have to say yes to other people, even when they do not really want to. The risk is that you become overburdened, resentful, angry and depressed. For the most part, saying no does not upset relationships. It can be helpful to keep saying no, but in different ways, until they get the message. Give yourself a challenge. We all feel nervous or afraid to do things at times. But people with healthy self-esteem do not let these feelings stop them trying new things or taking on challenges. Set yourself a goal, such as joining an exercise class or going to a social occasion. Achieving your goals will help to increase your self-esteem. Where to find help for low self-esteem. Talking therapies like counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help. You can refer yourself for talking therapies on the NHS. Find a talking therapies service in your area If you prefer, you can talk to a GP first and they can refer you. You could also find a private therapist. Make sure they're registered with a professional body."
"Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can ""snap out of"" by ""pulling yourself together"". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as ""watchful waiting"". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members.

"How it works - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help you make sense of overwhelming problems by breaking them down into smaller parts. In CBT, problems are broken down into 5 main areas: situations. thoughts. emotions. physical feelings. actions. CBT is based on the concept of these 5 areas being interconnected and affecting each other. For example, your thoughts about a certain situation can often affect how you feel both physically and emotionally, as well as how you act in response. How CBT is different. CBT differs from many other psychotherapies because it's: pragmatic – it helps identify specific problems and tries to solve them. highly structured – rather than talking freely about your life, you and your therapist discuss specific problems and set goals for you to achieve. focused on current problems – it's mainly concerned with how you think and act now rather than attempting to resolve past issues. collaborative – your therapist will not tell you what to do; they'll work with you to find solutions to your current difficulties. Stopping negative thought cycles. There are helpful and unhelpful ways of reacting to a situation, often determined by how you think about them. For example, if your marriage has ended in divorce, you might think you've failed and that you're not capable of having another meaningful relationship. This could lead to you feeling hopeless, lonely, depressed and tired, so you stop going out and meeting new people. You become trapped in a negative cycle, sitting at home alone and feeling bad about yourself. But rather than accepting this way of thinking you could accept that many marriages end, learn from your mistakes and move on, and feel optimistic about the future. This optimism could result in you becoming more socially active and you may start evening classes and develop a new circle of friends. This is a simplified example, but it illustrates how certain thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions can trap you in a negative cycle and even create new situations that make you feel worse about yourself. CBT aims to stop negative cycles such as these by breaking down things that make you feel bad, anxious or scared. By making your problems more manageable, CBT can help you change your negative thought patterns and improve the way you feel. CBT can help you get to a point where you can achieve this on your own and tackle problems without the help of a therapist. Exposure therapy. Exposure therapy is a form of CBT particularly useful for people with phobias or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) . In such cases, talking about the situation is not as helpful and you may need to learn to face your fears in a methodical and structured way through exposure therapy. Exposure therapy involves starting with items and situations that cause anxiety, but anxiety that you feel able to tolerate. You'll be exposed to an item or situation for a length of time and frequency recommended by your therapist. After the first few times, you'll find your anxiety does not climb as high and does not last as long. You'll then be ready to move to a more difficult situation. This process should be continued until you have tackled all the items and situations you want to conquer. Exposure therapy may involve spending 6 to 15 hours with the therapist, or can be carried out using self-help books or computer programs. You'll need to regularly practise the exercises as prescribed to overcome your problems. CBT sessions. CBT can be carried out with a therapist in 1-to-1 sessions or in groups with other people in a similar situation to you. If you have CBT on an individual basis, you'll usually meet with a CBT therapist for between 6 and 20 weekly or fortnightly sessions, with each session lasting 30 to 60 minutes. Because exposure therapy sessions include time to expose you to the item or situation causing you anxiety, they will usually last longer. CBT therapy may take place: in a clinic. outside – if you have specific fears there. in your own home – particularly if you have agoraphobia or OCD involving a specific fear of items at home. Your CBT therapist can be any healthcare professional who has been specially trained in CBT, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, mental health nurse or GP. First sessions. The first few sessions will be spent making sure CBT is the right therapy for you, and that you're comfortable with the process. The therapist will ask questions about your life and background. If you're anxious or depressed, the therapist will ask whether it interferes with your family, work and social life. They'll also ask about events that may be related to your problems, treatments you've had, and what you would like to achieve through therapy. If CBT seems appropriate, the therapist will let you know what to expect from a course of treatment. If it's not appropriate, or you do not feel comfortable with it, they can recommend alternative treatments. Further sessions. After the initial assessment period, you'll start working with your therapist to break down problems into their separate parts. To help with this, your therapist may ask you to keep a diary or write down your thought and behaviour patterns. You and your therapist will analyse your thoughts, feelings and behaviours to work out if they're unrealistic or unhelpful and to determine the effect they have on each other and on you. Your therapist will be able to help you work out how to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours. After working out what you can change, your therapist will ask you to practise these changes in your daily life. This may involve: questioning upsetting thoughts and replacing them with more helpful ones. recognising when you're going to do something that will make you feel worse and instead doing something more helpful. You may be asked to do some ""homework"" between sessions to help with this process. At each session, you'll discuss with your therapist how you've got on with putting the changes into practice and what it felt like. Your therapist will be able to make other suggestions to help you. Confronting fears and anxieties can be very difficult. Your therapist will not ask you to do things you do not want to do and will only work at a pace you're comfortable with. During your sessions, your therapist will check you're comfortable with the progress you're making. One of the biggest benefits of CBT is that after your course has finished, you can continue to apply the principles learned to your daily life. This should make it less likely that your symptoms will return. Online CBT. A number of interactive online tools are now available that allow you to benefit from CBT with minimal or no contact with a therapist. Some people prefer using a computer rather than talking to a therapist about their private feelings. However, you may still benefit from occasional meetings or phone calls with a therapist to guide you and monitor your progress. Find out more: self-help therapies.

"Overview - Phobias. A phobia is an overwhelming and debilitating fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal. Phobias are more pronounced than fears. They develop when a person has an exaggerated or unrealistic sense of danger about a situation or object. If a phobia becomes very severe, a person may organise their life around avoiding the thing that's causing them anxiety. As well as restricting their day-to-day life, it can also cause a lot of distress. Phobia symptoms. A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder . You may not experience any symptoms until you come into contact with the source of your phobia. But in some cases, even thinking about the source of a phobia can make a person feel anxious or panicky. This is known as anticipatory anxiety. Symptoms may include: unsteadiness, dizziness and lightheadedness. nausea. sweating. increased heart rate or palpitations. shortness of breath. trembling or shaking. an upset stomach. If you do not come into contact with the source of your phobia very often, it may not affect your everyday life. But if you have a complex phobia, such as agoraphobia , leading a normal life may be very difficult. Types of phobia. There are a wide variety of objects or situations that someone could develop a phobia about. But phobias can be divided into 2 main categories: specific or simple phobias. complex phobias. Specific or simple phobias. Specific or simple phobias centre around a particular object, animal, situation or activity. They often develop during childhood or adolescence and may become less severe as you get older. Common examples of simple phobias include: animal phobias – such as dogs, spiders, snakes or rodents. environmental phobias – such as heights, deep water and germs. situational phobias – such as visiting the dentist or flying. bodily phobias – such as blood, vomit or having injections. sexual phobias – such as performance anxiety or the fear of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Complex phobias. Complex phobias tend to be more disabling than simple phobias. They usually develop during adulthood and are often associated with a deep-rooted fear or anxiety about a particular situation or circumstance. The 2 most common complex phobias are: agoraphobia. social phobia. Agoraphobia is often thought of as a fear of open spaces, but it's much more complex than this. Someone with agoraphobia will feel anxious about being in a place or situation where escaping may be difficult if they have a panic attack. The anxiety usually results in the person avoiding situations such as: being alone. being in crowded places, such as busy restaurants or supermarkets. travelling on public transport. Social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder, centres around feeling anxious in social situations. If you have a social phobia, you might be afraid of speaking in front of people for fear of embarrassing yourself and being humiliated in public. In severe cases, this can become debilitating and may prevent you carrying out everyday activities, such as eating out or meeting friends. What causes phobias? Phobias do not seem to have a single cause, but there are a number of associated factors. For example: a phobia may be associated with a particular incident or trauma. a phobia may be a learned response that a person develops early in life from a parent or sibling (brother or sister). genetics may play a role – there's evidence to suggest that some people are born with a tendency to be more anxious than others. Diagnosing phobias. Phobias are not always formally diagnosed. Most people with a phobia are fully aware of the problem. A person will sometimes choose to live with a phobia, taking great care to avoid the object or situation they're afraid of. But if you have a phobia, continually trying to avoid what you're afraid of could make the situation worse. Ask a GP for help if you have a phobia. They may refer you to a specialist with expertise in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologist. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Find an NHS talking therapies service Treating phobias. Most phobias can be treated successfully. Simple phobias can be treated through gradual exposure to the object, animal, place or situation that causes fear and anxiety. This is known as desensitisation or self-exposure therapy. You could try these methods with the help of a professional or as part of a self-help programme . Treating complex phobias often takes longer and involves talking therapies, such as: counselling. psychotherapy. cognitive behavioural therapy. Medication may be prescribed to help with anxiety caused by certain phobias. Medicines that may be used include: antidepressants. tranquillisers. beta blockers. How common are phobias? Phobias are a common type of anxiety disorder . They can affect anyone, regardless of age, sex and social background. Some of the most common phobias include: arachnophobia – fear of spiders. claustrophobia – fear of confined spaces. agoraphobia – fear of open spaces and public places. social phobia – fear of social situations."
"Overview - Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be available if things go wrong. Many people assume agoraphobia is simply a fear of open spaces, but it's actually a more complex condition. Someone with agoraphobia may be scared of: travelling on public transport. visiting a shopping centre. leaving home. If someone with agoraphobia finds themselves in a stressful situation, they'll usually experience the symptoms of a panic attack , such as: rapid heartbeat. rapid breathing (hyperventilating). feeling hot and sweaty. feeling sick. They'll avoid situations that cause anxiety and may only leave the house with a friend or partner. They'll order groceries online rather than going to the supermarket. This change in behaviour is known as avoidance.  What causes agoraphobia? Agoraphobia can develop as a complication of panic disorder , an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks and moments of intense fear. It can arise by associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them. Not all people with agoraphobia have a history of panic attacks. In these cases, their fear may be related to issues like a fear of crime, terrorism, illness or being in an accident.  Diagnosing agoraphobia. Speak to your GP if you think you may be affected by agoraphobia. It should be possible to arrange a telephone consultation if you don't feel ready to visit your GP in person. Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they occur, and in what situations. It's very important you tell them how you've been feeling and how your symptoms are affecting you. Your GP may ask you the following questions: Do you find leaving the house stressful? Are there certain places or situations you have to avoid? Do you have any avoidance strategies to help you cope with your symptoms, such as relying on others to shop for you? It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions, and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment.  Treating agoraphobia. Lifestyle changes may help, including taking regular exercise , eating more healthily , and avoiding alcohol, drugs and drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. Self-help techniques that can help during a panic attack include staying where you are, focusing on something that's non-threatening and visible, and slow, deep breathing. If your agoraphobia fails to respond to these treatment methods, see your GP. You can also refer yourself directly for talking therapies, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , without seeing your GP. If you’re under 18, or want to get help for someone under 18, find out how to get mental health support for children and young people . Medication may be recommended if self-help techniques and lifestyle changes aren't effective in controlling your symptoms. You'll usually be prescribed a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) , which are also used to treat anxiety and depression . In severe cases of agoraphobia, medication can be used in combination with other types of treatment, such as CBT and relaxation therapy. "
"Symptoms - Agoraphobia. The severity of agoraphobia can vary significantly between individuals. For example, someone with severe agoraphobia may be unable to leave the house, whereas someone who has mild agoraphobia may be able to travel short distances without problems. The symptoms of agoraphobia can be broadly classified into 3 types: physical. cognitive. behavioural. Physical symptoms. The physical symptoms of agoraphobia usually only occur when you find yourself in a situation or environment that causes anxiety . However, many people with agoraphobia rarely experience physical symptoms because they deliberately avoid situations that make them anxious. The physical symptoms of agoraphobia can be similar to those of a panic attack and may include: rapid heartbeat. rapid breathing (hyperventilating). feeling hot and sweaty. feeling sick. chest pain. difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). diarrhoea. trembling. dizziness. ringing in the ears (tinnitus). feeling faint. Cognitive symptoms. The cognitive symptoms of agoraphobia are feelings or thoughts that can be, but aren't always, related to the physical symptoms. Cognitive symptoms may include fear that: a panic attack will make you look stupid or feel embarrassed in front of other people. a panic attack will be life threatening – for example, you may be worried your heart will stop or you'll be unable to breathe. you would be unable to escape from a place or situation if you were to have a panic attack. you're losing your sanity. you may lose control in public. you may tremble and blush in front of people. people may stare at you. There are also psychological symptoms that aren't related to panic attacks, such as: feeling you would be unable to function or survive without the help of others. a fear of being left alone in your house (monophobia). a general feeling of anxiety or dread. Behavioural symptoms. Symptoms of agoraphobia relating to behaviour include: avoiding situations that could lead to panic attacks, such as crowded places, public transport and queues. being housebound – not being able to leave the house for long periods of time. needing to be with someone you trust when going anywhere. avoiding being far away from home. Some people are able to force themselves to confront uncomfortable situations, but they feel considerable fear and anxiety while doing so. When to seek medical advice. Speak to your GP if you think you have the symptoms of agoraphobia."
"Causes - Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia can develop as a complication of panic disorder. Agoraphobia can sometimes develop if a person has a panic attack in a specific situation or environment. They begin to worry so much about having another panic attack that they feel the symptoms of a panic attack returning when they're in a similar situation or environment. This causes the person to avoid that particular situation or environment. Panic disorder. As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood. However, most experts think a combination of biological and psychological factors may be involved. Biological factors. 'Fight or flight' response Panic disorder is closely associated with your body's natural ""fight or flight"" response – its way of protecting you from stressful and dangerous situations. Anxiety and fear cause your body to release hormones, such as adrenaline, and your breathing and heart rate are increased. This is your body's natural way of preparing itself for a dangerous or stressful situation. In people with panic disorder, it's thought the fight or flight response is more intense, resulting in a panic attack. Psychological factors. Psychological factors that increase your risk of developing agoraphobia include: a traumatic childhood experience, such as the death of a parent or being sexually abused. experiencing a stressful event, such as bereavement, divorce, or losing your job. a previous history of mental illnesses, such as depression, anorexia nervosa or bulimia. alcohol misuse or drug misuse. being in an unhappy relationship, or in a relationship where your partner is very controlling. Agoraphobia without panic disorder. Occasionally, a person can develop symptoms of agoraphobia even though they don't have a history of panic disorder or panic attacks. This type of agoraphobia can be triggered by a number of different irrational fears ( phobias ), such as the fear of: being a victim of violent crime or a terrorist attack if you leave your house. becoming infected by a serious illness if you visit crowded places. doing something by accident that will result in you embarrassing or humiliating yourself in front of others."
"Overview - Anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa (often called anorexia) is an eating disorder and serious mental health condition. People who have anorexia try to keep their weight as low as possible. They may do this in different ways, such as not eating enough food, exercising too much, taking laxatives or making themselves sick (vomit). This can make them very ill because they start to starve. They often have a distorted image of their bodies, thinking they're fat even when they're underweight. Men and women of any age can get anorexia, but it's most common in young women and typically starts in the mid-teens. Signs and symptoms of anorexia. Signs and symptoms of anorexia include: if you're under 18, your weight and height being lower than the minimum expected for your age. if you're an adult, having an unusually low body mass index (BMI). missing meals or eating very little. thinking about food a lot and being very careful about what you eat, such as avoiding eating any foods you see as fattening. believing you're fat when you're a healthy weight or underweight. your periods stopping (in women who have not reached menopause) or not starting (in younger women and girls). physical problems, such as feeling lightheaded or dizzy, hair loss or dry skin. Some people with anorexia may also make themselves sick or do an extreme amount of exercise. Some use medicines to reduce their hunger (appetite suppressants), help them poo (laxatives) or make them pee (diuretics) to try to stop themselves gaining weight from any food they do eat. Getting help for anorexia. Getting help and support as soon as possible gives you the best chance of recovering from anorexia. If you think you may have anorexia, even if you're not sure, see a GP as soon as you can. They will ask you questions about your eating habits and how you're feeling. They will probably weigh you, and check your heart rate, blood pressure and temperature. They may also want to do some blood tests and to check your overall physical health. If they think you may have anorexia, or another eating disorder, they should refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists. It can be very hard to admit you have a problem and to ask for help. It may make things easier if you bring a friend or loved one with you to your appointment. You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from eating disorders charity Beat by calling its helpline on 0808 801 0677. Getting help for someone else. If you're concerned that a family member or friend may have anorexia, let them know you're worried about them and encourage them to see a GP. You could offer to go along with them.  Treatment for anorexia. You can recover from anorexia, but it may take time and recovery will be different for everyone. Your treatment plan will be tailored to you and should consider any other support you might need, such as for depression or anxiety. If you're over 18, you should be offered a type of talking therapy to help you manage your feelings about food and eating so that you are able to eat enough to be healthy. Talking therapies that are commonly used to treat anorexia in adults include: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Maudsley anorexia nervosa treatment for adults (MANTRA). specialist supportive clinical management (SSCM). If you're under 18, you should be offered family therapy. You may also be offered another type of talking therapy, such as CBT or adolescent-focused psychotherapy. Find out how to get mental health support for children and young people. Health risks of anorexia. Long-term anorexia can lead to severe health problems associated with not getting the right nutrients (malnutrition) . But these will usually begin to get better once your food intake starts improving. Possible complications include: problems with muscles and bones – including feeling tired and weak, osteoporosis, and problems with physical development in children and young adults. fertility problems. loss of sex drive. problems with the heart and blood vessels – including poor circulation, an irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, heart valve disease, heart failure, and swollen ankles, feet and legs (oedema). problems with the brain and nerves – including difficulties with concentration and memory or, less often, fits (seizures). kidney or bowel problems. having a weakened immune system or anaemia. Anorexia can also put your life at risk. It's one of the leading causes of deaths related to mental health problems. Deaths from anorexia may be due to physical complications or suicide. Causes of anorexia. We do not know exactly what causes anorexia and other eating disorders. You may be more likely to get an eating disorder if: you or a member of your family has a history of eating disorders, depression, or alcohol or drug addiction. you have been criticised for your eating habits, body shape or weight. you're overly concerned with being slim, particularly if you also feel pressure from society or your job – for example, ballet dancers, jockeys, models or athletes. you have anxiety, low self-esteem, an obsessive personality or are a perfectionist. you have been emotionally, physically or sexually abused."
"Advice for parents – Eating disorders. If your child has been diagnosed with an eating disorder, here's what you can do to help. Talk to them about it. If your child becomes withdrawn, touchy or moody, it might make it difficult to talk to them. It may be even more difficult if they cannot accept they have a problem. But talking about their condition is needed for their recovery, so keep trying. They might come across as angry, even if they're really feeling scared or insecure. It might be difficult for them to talk about their feelings, so be patient and listen to what they're trying to say. It can help if you: stay calm and prepare what you’re going to say to them – do not blame or judge them, just focus on how they're feeling. avoid talking about their appearance, even if you’re trying to say something nice. try to use sentences starting with ""I"", like, ""I'm worried because you do not seem happy"", rather than sentences beginning with ""you"". avoid discussing people's diets or weight problems. try not to feel hurt if they do not open up straight away. do not be upset if they're being secretive because this is part of their illness not their relationship with you. Try these mealtime tips. Mealtimes can be particularly difficult. You may find the following advice helpful: if your child is in treatment, ask their treatment team for advice on how to cope with mealtimes. try to make meal plans with your child that you both agree to. agree with the family that none of you will talk about portion sizes, calories or anything else about the meal. avoid eating low-calorie or diet foods in front of them or having them in the house. try to keep things lighthearted and positive throughout the meal, even if you do not feel that way on the inside. if your child tries to get too involved in cooking the meal as a way of controlling it, gently ask them to set the table or wash up instead. try not to focus too much on them during mealtimes – enjoy your own meal and try to make conversation. a family activity after the meal, such as a game or watching TV, can help distract them from wanting to purge or overexercise. do not worry if a meal goes badly, and just move on. Support for your child. If your child is being treated for an eating disorder, their treatment team will play a big part in their recovery. But do not underestimate the importance of your love and support. It may help to: learn as much as possible about eating disorders, so you understand what you're dealing with. keep telling them that you love them and will always be there for them. make them aware of the professional help available. suggest activities they could do that do not involve food, such as hobbies and spending time with friends. try to be honest about your own feelings, as this will encourage them to do the same. be a good role model by eating a balanced diet and doing a healthy amount of exercise. try to build their confidence, for example, praise them for being thoughtful or congratulate them on something they've done. Get support for yourself. Ask a GP or a health professional in your child's treatment team for advice on how to help at home. It's important the whole family understands the situation and has support. The following organisations offer advice online: Beat: supporting someone. Family Lives: eating disorders. Young Minds: eating disorders – a guide for parents and carers. You can also ask your GP about support groups for parents caring for someone with an eating disorder."
"Talking to your teenager. Getting teenagers to talk openly about what's bothering them can be hard. Follow these tips to help get them talking to you about their worries. Do not judge your teenager. Start by assuming they have a good reason for doing what they do. Show them you respect their intelligence and are curious about the choices they've made. If you do not pre-judge their behaviour as ""stupid"" or ""wrong"", they're more likely to open up and explain why their actions made sense to them. Try not to assume you know what's wrong. Do not assume that you know what's wrong. Rather than asking ""Are you being bullied?"", try saying ""I've been worried about you. You do not seem your usual self, and I wondered what's going on with you at the moment? Is there anything I can help with?"". Be clear you want to help. If you suspect your child is using drugs or drinking excessively, be gentle but direct. Ask them, and let them know that you'll help them through any of their difficulties. Be honest yourself. Teenagers will criticise you if you do not follow your own advice. If you drink too much alcohol yourself, for example, they're likely to mention it ("" You cannot talk!""). Make sure you're acting responsibly yourself. Help your teenager think for themselves. Instead of trying to be the expert on your teenager's life, try to help them think for themselves: Discuss the potential implications of poor behaviour choices. For example, ""How does smoking weed make you feel the next day? So, if you feel like that, how's that going to affect you playing football?"". Help them think critically about what they see and hear. ""So Paul said X: is that what you think?"". Help them feel that they can deal with life's challenges. Remind them of what they're good at and what you like about them. This will give them confidence in other areas of their lives. Information is empowering. Point them towards websites that can give them information on drugs, sex and smoking so they can read the facts and make up their own minds. Help them think of ways they can respond and cope. ""So, when you feel like that, is there anything you can do to make yourself feel better?"". Encourage them to think through the pros and cons of their behaviour. Pick your battles with your teenager. If they only ever hear nagging from you, they'll stop listening. Overlooking minor issues, such as the clothes they wear, may mean you're still talking to each other when you need to negotiate – or stand firm – with them on bigger issues, such as drugs and sex. Try not to react to angry outbursts. Teenagers often hit out at the people they most love and trust, not because they hate you, but because they feel confused. Do not think that they mean the bad things they say (""I hate you!""). They may just feel confused, angry, upset, lost or hormonal, and they do not know how to express it. Help your teenager feel safe. Teenagers often worry that telling an adult will just make things worse. You need to be clear that you want to help them and will not do anything they do not want you to. This may be particularly important with bullying. If your child opens up to you about bullying, explain that it is unacceptable. Listen to their fears and reassure them it's not their fault. Help build up their confidence by reassuring them that you'll face the problem together. Ask your teenager the right questions. Sometimes you'll find out more about your teenager if you ask open questions. If they have an eating disorder, for example, asking confrontational questions like ""What did you eat for lunch?"" or ""Have you made yourself sick?"" may mean you get a dishonest answer. Sticking to open questions such as ""How are you?"" or ""How has your day been?"" helps your teenager talk to you about how they're feeling."
"Helping your child with anger issues. Anger is a normal and useful emotion. It can tell children when things are not fair or right.

"Talking to your child about feelings. If you're worried about a child, encouraging them to talk can be very helpful, whether you're a parent, grandparent, friend or teacher. If you think a child you know has a problem, it can be hard to know how to start talking to them about it. When there are problems at home, such as parents fighting, divorce or a death in the family, children can become withdrawn and upset. Being able to talk to someone other than a parent is sometimes very helpful for children. Grandparents, uncles, aunts, teachers or even a counsellor can all offer support. Look for clues in their play. Children express themselves through play as well as words. You can learn a lot about how they're feeling by simply spending time with them and watching them play. Stressed and upset children often play fighting games with their toys. Comment on this by saying, ""There are a lot of fights going on"" or ""It seems pretty frightening"". This can help to get them talking about what's bothering them. Even if you do not start a conversation, you'll be making the child feel more comfortable with you, paving the way for them to open up to you about their problems. If you can get them talking, gently ask what's wrong. But if the child does not want to open up, let the subject go. You can then repeat the process at another time until they're ready to tell you what's bothering them. If a child is too frightened to talk. If you're worried that a child you know might be being abused, it can help to ask a question like, ""Is mummy getting very cross with you? You can tell me about it if you want to"". A child might not understand that they're being abused. They may simply see it as a parent being angry or annoyed with them. Children who are being sexually abused often do not talk about it because they think it's their fault or they have been convinced by their abuser that it's normal or a ""special secret"". See more about spotting signs of child sexual abuse . Children will often ask if you're going to tell anyone about what they've told you. Never promise not to tell, but explain that you'll only tell other people who want to help. If you suspect abuse, encourage them to call ChildLine (0800 1111) or ring the NSPCC yourself (0808 800 5000) and get advice about how to report it. If a child is aggressive or misbehaving. If a child is fighting or being aggressive, they're doing it for a good reason, and talking may help you discover the reason. Start by telling the child that their bad behaviour is unacceptable and why – for example, because it will harm other people or get them into trouble. Then offer them the chance to talk about why they're angry. This might not work instantly because an angry child might not listen to you straight away. Do not give up. Children are aware when they're behaving badly, and it's important to find out the reasons why. See more about helping your child with anger issues . If your child is worried about scary news. In this digital age it is virtually impossible to stop children from finding out about upsetting news events, such as terrorism, war and violent crime, that they may find traumatic. Advice from the Mental Health Foundation includes: do not try to blackout all exposure to news; this is both unlikely to succeed and could actually increase their fears. be truthful about what has happened. let them know it is normal to be concerned and tell them you're also concerned. encourage them to ask questions if they seem unclear about what has happened. reassure them that you will do everything you can to keep them safe. The Mental Health Foundation has advice about talking to your children about scary world news . If your child is grieving. Young children do not always understand what death means. It helps to explain it by saying, ""Nana's died. She's not going to be with us any more."" Watch children carefully if someone close to them has died. If they seem tearful or withdrawn, encourage them to open up about how they're feeling by talking about the person who's died. You could say something like, ""It's very sad that Nana has died"" or ""I feel sad that Nana has died, and sometimes it's hard to understand why people die"".

If the GP thinks your child could have an anxiety disorder, they may refer them for an assessment with your local children and young people's mental health services (CYPMHS) . Specialist CYPMHS are NHS mental health services that focus on the needs of children and young people. CYPMHS workers are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems, including anxiety. If your child does not want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help directly from a local youth counselling service. For more information, visit Youth Access . You may also want to talk to your child's school about their anxiety and any support they need. Treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people. The type of treatment offered will depend on your child's age and the cause of their anxiety. Counselling can help your child understand what's making them anxious and allow them to work through the situation. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their anxiety by changing the way they think and behave. This could be in person or as self-help online. Anxiety medicines may be offered to your child if their anxiety is severe or does not get better with talking therapies. They're usually only prescribed by doctors who specialise in children and young people's mental health. What causes anxiety disorders in children and young people. Having a close family member with anxiety may increase your child's chance of having it too. Children can also pick up anxious behaviour from being around anxious people. Some children develop anxiety after stressful events, such as: frequently moving house or school. parents fighting or arguing. the death of a close relative or friend. becoming seriously ill or getting injured in an accident. school-related issues like exams or bullying. being abused or neglected. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders are more likely to have problems with anxiety. More information and support. For you.

"Social anxiety (social phobia). Social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is a long-term and overwhelming fear of social situations. It's a common problem that usually starts during the teenage years. It can be very distressing and have a big impact on your life. For some people it gets better as they get older. But for many people it does not go away on its own without treatment. It's important to get help if you are having symptoms. There are treatments that can help you manage it. Symptoms of social anxiety. Social anxiety is more than shyness. It's a fear that does not go away and affects everyday activities, self confidence, relationships and work or school life.

You may also find it useful to read an NHS self-help guide for social anxiety . Treatments for social anxiety. A number of treatments are available for social anxiety. The main options are: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a therapist, which is therapy that helps you identify negative thought patterns and behaviours, and change them; this can be done with just you and a therapist, in a group or with your parents or carers. guided self-help, which involves working through a CBT-based workbook or online course with regular support from a therapist. antidepressant medicines, usually a type of medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as escitalopram or sertraline; these are usually not used to treat children and young people. CBT is generally considered the best treatment, but other treatments may help if it does not work or you do not want to try it. Some people need to try a combination of treatments. Support groups. There are several charities, support groups and online forums for people with social anxiety and other anxiety disorders, including: Anxiety UK. a HealthUnlocked anxiety forum run by Anxiety Support.

It may also take place in a small group."
"Symptoms - Generalised anxiety disorder in adults. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can affect you both physically and mentally. How severe the symptoms are varies from person to person. Some people have only a few symptoms, while others have many more. You should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress. Psychological symptoms of GAD. GAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things, resulting in symptoms such as: restlessness. a sense of dread or fear. feeling constantly ""on edge"". difficulty concentrating. irritability. Your symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact (seeing your family and friends) to avoid feelings of worry and fear. You may also find going to work difficult and stressful, and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem. Physical symptoms of GAD. GAD can also have a number of physical symptoms, including: dizziness. tiredness. a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations). muscle aches and tension. trembling or shaking. dry mouth. excessive sweating. shortness of breath. stomach ache. feeling sick. headache. pins and needles. difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia)."
"Diagnosis - Generalised anxiety disorder in adults. See your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can be difficult to diagnose. In some cases, it can also be difficult to distinguish from other mental health conditions, such as depression . You may have GAD if: your worrying significantly affects your daily life, including your job and social life. your worries are extremely stressful and upsetting. you worry about all sorts of things and have a tendency to think the worst. your worrying is uncontrollable. you have felt worried nearly every day for at least 6 months. Talking to your GP about anxiety. Your GP may ask you questions about: any physical or psychological symptoms and how long you have had them for. your worries, fears and emotions. your personal life. You may find it difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life. But it's important that your GP understands your symptoms and circumstances so the correct diagnosis can be made. You're most likely to be diagnosed with GAD if you have had symptoms for 6 months or more. Finding it difficult to manage your feelings of anxiety is also an indication that you may have the condition. To help with the diagnosis, your GP may carry out a physical examination or blood tests to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such as: anaemia (a deficiency in iron or vitamin B 12 and folate). an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)."
"Treatment - Generalised anxiety disorder in adults. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a long-term condition, but a number of different treatments can help. If you have other problems alongside GAD, such as depression or alcohol misuse , these may need to be treated before you have treatment specifically for GAD. Psychological therapies for GAD. If you have been diagnosed with GAD, you'll usually be advised to try psychological treatment before you're prescribed medication. You can get talking therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and applied relaxation on the NHS. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Or your GP can refer you if you prefer. Find an NHS talking therapies service Guided self-help and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Your GP or talking therapies service may suggest trying a self-help course to see if it can help you learn to cope with your anxiety. Self-help courses for GAD are usually based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . CBT is a type of talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. CBT is one of the most effective treatments for GAD. There are several ways you may be offered self-help and CBT: you work through a CBT workbook or computer course in your own time. you work through a CBT workbook or computer course with the support of a therapist who you see every 1 or 2 weeks. you take part in a group course where you and other people with similar problems meet with a therapist every week to learn ways to tackle your anxiety. If these initial treatments don't help, you'll usually be offered more intensive CBT where you usually have weekly sessions with a therapist for 3 to 4 months, or another type of therapy called applied relaxation or medication. You can try some self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques on the Every Mind Matters website . This is not a full CBT course or guided self-help, but it has practical self-help tips and strategies based on CBT techniques. Applied relaxation. Applied relaxation focuses on relaxing your muscles in a particular way during situations that usually cause anxiety. The technique needs to be taught by a trained therapist and generally involves: learning how to relax your muscles. learning how to relax your muscles quickly and in response to a trigger, such as the word ""relax"". practising relaxing your muscles in situations that make you anxious. As with CBT, applied relaxation therapy will usually mean meeting with a therapist for a 1-hour session every week for 3 to 4 months. Relaxation therapy may not be available in all areas, so you might be offered CBT instead. Medication. If the psychological treatments above haven't helped or you'd prefer not to try them, you'll usually be offered medication. Your GP can prescribe a variety of different types of medication to treat GAD. Some medication is designed to be taken on a short-term basis, while others are prescribed for longer periods. Depending on your symptoms, you may need medication to treat your physical symptoms, as well as your psychological ones. If you're considering taking medication for GAD, your GP should discuss the different options with you in detail before you start a course of treatment, including: the different types of medication. length of treatment. side effects and possible interactions with other medicines. which medication is best for you if you’re pregnant, planning a pregnancy or breastfeeding. You should also have regular appointments with your doctor to assess your progress when you're taking medication for GAD. These will usually take place every 2 to 4 weeks for the first 3 months, then every 3 months after that. Tell your GP if you think you may be experiencing side effects from your medication. They may be able to adjust your dose or prescribe an alternative medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In most cases, the first medication you'll be offered will be a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . This type of medication works by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. Examples of SSRIs you may be prescribed include: sertraline. escitalopram. paroxetine. SSRIs can be taken on a long-term basis but, as with all antidepressants, they can take several weeks to start working. You'll usually be started on a low dose, which may be gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medication. Common side effects of SSRIs include: feeling agitated. feeling or being sick. indigestion. diarrhoea or constipation. loss of appetite and weight loss. dizziness. blurred vision. dry mouth. excessive sweating. headaches. problems sleeping (insomnia) or drowsiness. low sex drive. difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation. in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). These side effects should improve over time, although some may be related to your underlying condition. Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). If SSRIs don't help ease your anxiety, you may be prescribed a different type of antidepressant known as a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). This type of medication increases the amount of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. Examples of SNRIs you may be prescribed include: venlafaxine. duloxetine. Common side effects of SNRIs include: feeling sick. headaches. drowsiness. dizziness. dry mouth. constipation. insomnia. sweating. sexual problems, such as low sex drive or difficulty getting an erection. SNRIs can also increase your blood pressure, so your blood pressure will be monitored regularly during treatment. As with SSRIs, some of the side effects (such as feeling sick, an upset stomach, problems sleeping and feeling agitated or more anxious) are more common in the first 1 or 2 weeks of treatment, but these usually settle as your body adjusts to the medication. Stopping antidepressants. If your medication is not helping after about 2 months of treatment or it's causing unpleasant side effects, your GP may prescribe an alternative medication. When you and your GP decide it's appropriate for you to stop taking your medication, you'll normally have your dose slowly reduced over the course of a few weeks to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects. Never stop taking your medication unless your GP specifically advises you to. Pregabalin. If SSRIs and SNRIs aren't suitable for you, you may be offered pregabalin . This is a medication known as an anticonvulsant, which is used to treat conditions such as epilepsy , but it's also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety. Side effects of pregabalin can include: drowsiness. dizziness. increased appetite and weight gain. blurred vision. headaches. dry mouth. vertigo. Benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment during a particularly severe period of anxiety. This is because they help ease the symptoms within 30 to 90 minutes of taking the medication. If you're prescribed a benzodiazepine, it'll usually be diazepam . Although benzodiazepines are very effective in treating the symptoms of anxiety, they can't be used for long periods. This is because they can become addictive if used for longer than 4 weeks. Benzodiazepines also start to lose their effectiveness after this time. For these reasons, you won't usually be prescribed benzodiazepines for any longer than 2 to 4 weeks at a time. Side effects of benzodiazepines can include: drowsiness. difficulty concentrating. headaches. vertigo. an uncontrollable shake or tremble in part of the body (tremor). low sex drive. As drowsiness is a particularly common side effect of benzodiazepines, your ability to drive or operate machinery may be affected by taking this medication. You should avoid these activities during treatment. You should also never drink alcohol or use opiate drugs when taking benzodiazepine as doing so can be dangerous. Referral to a specialist. If you have tried the treatments mentioned above and have significant symptoms of GAD, you may want to discuss with your GP whether you should be referred to a mental health specialist. A referral will work differently in different areas of the UK, but you'll usually be referred to your community mental health team. These teams include a range of specialists, including: psychiatrists. psychiatric nurses. clinical psychologists. occupational therapists. social workers. An appropriate mental health specialist from your local team will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They'll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. They may also ask about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends. Your specialist will then be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to treat your symptoms. As part of this plan, you may be offered a treatment you haven't tried before, which might be psychological treatments or medication. Alternatively, you may be offered a combination of a psychological treatment with a medication, or a combination of 2 different medications."
"Overview - Antidepressants. Antidepressants are a type of medicine used to treat clinical depression . They can also be used to treat a number of other conditions, including: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). generalised anxiety disorder. post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Antidepressants are also sometimes used to treat people with long-term (chronic) pain.  How antidepressants work. It's not known exactly how antidepressants work. It's thought they work by increasing levels of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, are linked to mood and emotion. Neurotransmitters may also affect pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain. While antidepressants can treat the symptoms of depression, they do not always address its causes. This is why they're usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions. How effective are antidepressants? Research suggests that antidepressants can be helpful for people with moderate or severe depression. They're not usually recommended for mild depression, unless other treatments like talking therapy have not helped. Doses and duration of treatment. Antidepressants are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. Antidepressants usually need to be taken for 1 or 2 weeks (without missing a dose) before the benefit starts to be felt. It's important not to stop taking them if you get some mild side effects early on, as these effects usually wear off quickly. If you take an antidepressant for 4 weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying a different medicine. A course of treatment usually lasts for at least 6 months after you start to feel better. Some people with recurrent depression may be advised to take them indefinitely.  Side effects. Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Always check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see what the possible side effects are. The most common side effects of antidepressants are usually mild. Side effects should improve within a few days or weeks of treatment, as the body gets used to the medicine.  cautions and interactions of antidepressants. Coming off antidepressants. Talk to your doctor before you stop taking antidepressants. It's important that you do not stop taking antidepressants suddenly. Once you're ready to come off antidepressants, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks – or longer, if you have been taking them for a long time. This is to help prevent any withdrawal symptoms you might get as a reaction to coming off the medicine.  Types of antidepressants. There are several different types of antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs are the most widely prescribed type of antidepressants. They're usually preferred over other antidepressants, as they cause fewer side effects. An overdose is also less likely to be serious. Fluoxetine is probably the best known SSRI (sold under the brand name Prozac). Other SSRIs include citalopram (Cipramil), escitalopram (Cipralex), paroxetine (Seroxat) and sertraline (Lustral). Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). SNRIs are similar to SSRIs. They were designed to be a more effective antidepressant than SSRIs. However, the evidence that SNRIs are more effective in treating depression is uncertain. It seems that some people respond better to SSRIs, while others respond better to SNRIs. Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta and Yentreve) and venlafaxine (Efexor). Noradrenaline and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs). NASSAs may be effective for some people who are unable to take SSRIs. The side effects of NASSAs are similar to those of SSRIs, but they're thought to cause fewer sexual problems. However, they may also cause more drowsiness at first. The main NASSA prescribed in the UK is mirtazapine (Zispin). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). TCAs are an older type of antidepressant. They're no longer usually recommended as the first treatment for depression because they can be more dangerous if an overdose is taken. They also cause more unpleasant side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs. Exceptions are sometimes made for people with severe depression that fail to respond to other treatments. TCAs may also be recommended for other mental health conditions, such as OCD and bipolar disorder. Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline , clomipramine, dosulepin , imipramine, lofepramine and nortriptyline . Some types of TCAs, such as amitriptyline, can also be used to treat chronic nerve pain. Serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs). SARIs are not usually the first choice of antidepressant, but they may be prescribed if other antidepressants have not worked or have caused side effects. The main SARI prescribed in the UK is trazodone (Molipaxin). Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOIs are an older type of antidepressant that are rarely used nowadays. They can cause potentially serious side effects so should only be prescribed by a specialist doctor. Examples of MAOIs include tranylcypromine, phenelzine and isocarboxazid. Other treatments for depression. Other treatments for depression include talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . People with moderate to severe depression are usually treated using a combination of antidepressants and CBT. Antidepressants work quickly in reducing symptoms, whereas CBT takes time to deal with causes of depression and ways of overcoming it. Regular exercise has also been shown to be useful for those with mild depression.  Yellow Card Scheme. The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking. It's run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). See the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information."
"Overview - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. OCD can affect men, women and children. People can start having symptoms from as early as 6 years old, but it often begins around puberty and early adulthood. OCD can be distressing and significantly interfere with your life, but treatment can help you keep it under control. Symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). If you have OCD, you'll usually experience frequent obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. An obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters your mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease. A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that you feel you need to do to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought. For example, someone with an obsessive fear of being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave their house. Women can sometimes have OCD during pregnancy or after their baby is born. Obsessions may include worrying about harming the baby or not sterilising feeding bottles properly. Compulsions could be things such as repeatedly checking the baby is breathing, and intrusive, unwanted and unpleasant thoughts, images or urges. These can cause anxiety and lead to repetitive behaviours. If you keep getting these thoughts and they have an effect on your daily life, speak to your GP or health visitor. They can support you or refer you to a specialist mental health team if you need it. Getting help for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with OCD are sometimes reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. OCD is a health condition like any other, so there's nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. Having OCD does not mean you're ""mad"" and it's not your fault you have it. There are 2 main ways to get help: refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service – find an NHS talking therapies service in your area. see a GP – they'll ask about your symptoms and can refer you to a local talking therapies service if necessary. If you think a friend or family member may have OCD, try talking to them about your concerns and suggest they get help. If you’re under 18, or want to get help for someone under 18, find out how to get mental health support for children and young people . It's unlikely OCD will get better without proper treatment and support. Treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). There are some effective treatments for OCD that can help reduce the impact it has on your life. The main treatments are: talking therapy – usually cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which helps you face your fears and obsessive thoughts without ""putting them right"" through compulsions. medicine – usually a type of antidepressant medicine called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can help by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain. CBT will usually have an effect quite quickly. It can take up to 12 weeks before you notice the effects of treatment with SSRIs, but most people will eventually benefit. If these treatments do not help, you may be offered: an alternative SSRI. a combination of an SSRI and CBT. an antidepressant called clomipramine. Some people may be referred to a specialist mental health service for further treatment. Causes of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). It's not clear what causes OCD. A number of different factors may play a part, including: family history – you're more likely to develop OCD if a family member has it. It may be learned behaviour, or possibly because of your genes. differences in the brain – some people with OCD have areas of unusually high activity in their brain or low levels of a chemical called serotonin. life events – OCD may be more common in people who have been bullied, abused or neglected, and it sometimes starts after an important life event, such as childbirth or a bereavement. personality – neat, meticulous, methodical people with high personal standards may be more likely to develop OCD, also people who are generally quite anxious or have a very strong sense of responsibility for themselves and others. Support groups. Living with OCD can be difficult. In addition to getting medical help, you might find it helps to contact a support group or other people with OCD for information and advice. The following websites may be useful sources of support: OCD Action. OCD-UK. TOP UK. HealthUnlocked OCD support forum. OCD Action, OCD-UK and TOP UK can also let you know about any local support groups in your area. Information: Social care and support guide. The social care and support guide has advice about where you can get support if you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled, including family members."
"Overview - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used type of antidepressant . They're mainly prescribed to treat depression , particularly persistent or severe cases, and are often used in combination with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . SSRIs are usually the first choice medicine for depression because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. As well as depression, SSRIs can be used to treat a number of other mental health conditions, including: generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). panic disorder. severe phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia. bulimia. post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). SSRIs can sometimes be used to treat other conditions, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) , fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . Occasionally, they may also be prescribed to treat pain. How SSRIs work. It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as ""reuptake""). SSRIs work by blocking (""inhibiting"") reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment, such as CBT. Doses and duration of treatment. SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. SSRIs usually need to be taken for 2 to 4 weeks before the benefit is felt. You may experience mild side effects early on, but it's important that you don't stop taking the medicine. These effects will usually wear off quickly. If you take an SSRI for 4 to 6 weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. A course of treatment usually continues for at least 6 months after you feel better, although longer courses are sometimes recommended and some people with recurrent problems may be advised to take them indefinitely. Things to consider. SSRIs can be prescribed if you're pregnant, breastfeeding or under 18, but this depends if your GP thinks that the benefits outweigh the risks. Talk to them about what's best for you or your child. SSRIs also need to be used with caution if you have certain underlying health problems, including diabetes , epilepsy and kidney disease . Some SSRIs can react unpredictably with other medicines, including some over-the-counter painkillers and herbal remedies, such as St John's wort. Always read the information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medicine to check if there are any medicines you need to avoid. Side effects. Most people will only experience a few mild side effects when taking SSRIs. These can be troublesome at first, but they'll generally improve with time. Common side effects of SSRIs can include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious. diarrhoea and feeling or being sick. dizziness. blurred vision. loss of libido (reduced sex drive). difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation. in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). You'll usually need to see your doctor every few weeks when you first start taking SSRIs to discuss how well the medicine is working. You can also contact your doctor at any point if you experience any troublesome or persistent side effects. Types of SSRIs. There are currently 8 SSRIs prescribed in the UK: citalopram (Cipramil). dapoxetine (Priligy). escitalopram (Cipralex). fluoxetine (Prozac or Oxactin). fluvoxamine (Faverin). paroxetine (Seroxat). sertraline (Lustral). vortioxetine (Brintellix)."
"Overview - Bulimia. Bulimia is an eating disorder and mental health condition. People who have bulimia go through periods where they eat a lot of food in a very short amount of time (binge eating) and then purge the food from their body to try to stop themselves gaining weight. Purging could include making themselves vomit, using laxatives (medicine to help them poo) or diuretics (medicine that makes you pee more), fasting or doing excessive exercise, or a combination of these. Anyone can get bulimia, but it is more common in young people aged 15 to 25. Symptoms of bulimia. Symptoms of bulimia include: eating very large amounts of food in a short time, often in an out-of-control way – this is called binge eating. making yourself vomit, using laxatives or diuretics, fasting, or doing an extreme amount of exercise after a binge to avoid putting on weight – this is called purging. fear of putting on weight. being very critical about your weight and body shape. mood changes – for example, feeling very tense or anxious. These symptoms may not be easy to spot in someone else because bulimia can make people behave very secretively. Getting help for bulimia. Getting help and support as soon as possible gives you the best chance of recovering from bulimia. If you think you may have bulimia, see a GP as soon as you can. They'll ask you questions about your eating habits and how you're feeling, and will check your overall health and weight. If they think you may have bulimia or another eating disorder, they should refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists. It can be very hard to admit you have a problem and ask for help. It may make things easier if you bring a friend or loved one with you to your appointment. You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from the eating disorders charity Beat by calling their helpline on 0808 801 0677. Getting help for someone else. If you're concerned that someone close to you may have bulimia, let them know you're worried about them and encourage them to see a GP. You could offer to go along with them.  Treatment for bulimia. You can recover from bulimia, but it may take time and recovery will be different for everyone. Your treatment plan will be tailored to you and should take into account any other support you might need, such as for depression or anxiety. If you're over 18, you'll probably be offered a guided self-help programme. This involves working through a self-help book or online programme, and often includes keeping a diary and making a plan for your meals. You'll be supported by a therapist during this process. You may also be offered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . If you're under 18, you may be offered family therapy or CBT.

Bulimia can eventually lead to physical problems associated with not getting the right nutrients, vomiting a lot, or overusing laxatives. Possible complications include: feeling tired and weak. dental problems – stomach acid from persistent vomiting can damage tooth enamel. bad breath, a sore throat, or even tears in the lining of the throat – also caused by stomach acid. irregular or absent periods. dry skin and hair. brittle fingernails. swollen glands. fits and muscle spasms. heart, kidney or bowel problems, including constipation. bone problems – you may be more likely to develop problems such as low bone density (osteopenia) particularly if you have had symptoms of both bulimia and anorexia. Causes of bulimia. We do not know exactly what causes bulimia and other eating disorders. You may be more likely to get an eating disorder if: you or a member of your family has a history of eating disorders, depression, or alcohol or drug addiction. you have been criticised for your eating habits, body shape or weight. you're overly concerned with being slim, particularly if you also feel pressure from society or your job. you have anxiety, low self-esteem or an obsessive personality. you've experienced a stressful event or trauma, such as physical or sexual abuse. Binge-purge cycle. Bulimia is often a vicious cycle of binging and purging, triggered by things such as hunger, sadness or stress. Periods of excessive eating and loss of control (binge eating) may be used as a way of coping with difficult emotions. You may then feel guilty or ashamed. You then purge to get rid of the calories, leaving you feeling hungry again, and the cycle continues. You may set very strict rules for yourself about dieting, eating or exercising."
"Symptoms - Bulimia. The main signs of bulimia are eating a large amount of food over a very short time (binge eating) and then ridding your body of the extra food (purging) by making yourself vomit, taking laxatives or diuretics, fasting or exercising excessively, or a combination of these. Other signs of bulimia include: fear of putting on weight. being very critical about your weight and body shape. mood changes – feeling very tense or anxious, for example. thinking about food a lot. feeling guilty and ashamed, and behaving secretively. avoiding social activities that involve food. feeling like you have no control over your eating. You may also notice physical signs like: feeling tired. a sore throat from being sick. bloating or tummy pain. a puffy face. self-harming. Warning signs of bulimia in someone else. The following warning signs could indicate that someone you care about has an eating disorder: eating a lot of food, very fast. going to the bathroom a lot after eating. excessively or obsessively exercising. Getting help. Getting help and support as soon as possible gives you the best chance of recovering from bulimia. If you think you may have bulimia, see a GP as soon as possible. If you are concerned that someone close to you may have bulimia, let them know you are worried about them and encourage them to see a GP. You could offer to go along with them. You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from eating disorders charity Beat , by calling their helpline on 0808 801 0677."
"Treatment - Bulimia. Treatment may take time, but you can recover from bulimia. Treatment for bulimia is slightly different for adults and those under 18 years old. Treatment for adults. Guided help. You will probably be offered a guided self-help programme as a first step in treating your bulimia. This often involves working through a self-help book or online programme combined with sessions with a healthcare professional, such as a therapist. Joining a self-help support group, like one of the Beat online support groups for people with bulimia, may be helpful to you. If self-help treatment alone is not enough or has not helped you after 4 weeks, you may be offered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or another type of therapy, as well as a medicine. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If you are offered CBT, it will usually involve up to 20 sessions across 20 weeks. CBT involves talking to a therapist, who will help you explore emotions and thoughts that could be contributing to your eating disorder, and how you feel about your weight and body shape. They will help you to adopt regular eating habits and show you how to stick to them. They should also show you ways to manage difficult feelings and situations to stop you from relapsing once your therapy ends. Treatment for children and young people. Family therapy. Children and young people will usually be offered family therapy. This involves you and your family talking to a therapist, exploring how bulimia has affected you and how your family can support you to get better. This may be offered through your local children and young people's mental health services. If family therapy is not suitable, you may be offered CBT, which will be similar to the CBT offered to adults. Looking after yourself. It's important to look after your health while recovering from bulimia. If you are vomiting regularly, the acid in your vomit can damage your teeth over time. In order to minimise this damage you should: avoid brushing your teeth immediately after vomiting so you do not wear away the enamel. rinse your mouth with a non-acidic mouthwash. make sure you see your dentist regularly. do not drink or eat acidic foods, such as fruit juice, during a binge and after purging. do not smoke. Vomiting can also lead to risk of dehydration . You can be treated for this if needed. Medicine. Antidepressants should not be offered as the only treatment for bulimia. But you may be offered an antidepressant, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) , in combination with therapy or self-help treatment, to help you manage other conditions, such as: anxiety or depression. social anxiety (social phobia). obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Antidepressants are rarely prescribed for children or young people under 18. Where treatment will happen. Most people with bulimia will be able to stay at home during their treatment. You'll usually have appointments at your clinic and then be able to go home. However, you may be admitted to hospital if you have serious health complications, including: being very underweight. being very ill and your life being at risk. being under 18 and your doctors believing you do not have enough support at home. doctors being worried that you might harm yourself or are at risk of suicide. Your doctors will keep a very careful eye on your weight and health if you're being cared for in hospital. They will help you to reach a healthy weight gradually, and either start or continue any therapy you're having. Once they are happy with your weight, as well as your physical and mental health, you should be able to return home. Further support for bulimia. There are many organisations that support people with bulimia and their families, including: Beat: beating eating disorders. Mental Health Foundation. Mind."
"How to help someone with an eating disorder. If a friend or relative has an eating disorder, such as anorexia , bulimia or binge eating disorder , you will probably want to do everything you can to help them recover. You're already doing a great job by finding out more about eating disorders and how to try to support them – it shows you care and helps you understand how they might be feeling. Getting professional help from a doctor, practice nurse, or a school or college nurse will give your friend or relative the best chance of getting better. But this can be one of the most difficult steps for someone living with an eating disorder, so try to encourage them to get help or offer to go along with them. You can support them in other ways, too: Keep trying to include them – they may not want to go out or join in with activities, but keep trying to talk to them and ask them along, just like before. Even if they do not join in, they will still like to be asked. It will make them feel valued as a person. Try to build up their self-esteem – perhaps by telling them what a great person they are, and how much you appreciate having them in your life and that you're happy to support them. Give your time, listen to them and try not to give advice or criticise – this can be tough when you do not agree with what they say about themselves and what they eat. Remember, you do not have to know all the answers. Just making sure they know you're there for them is what's important. This is especially true when it feels like your friend or relative is rejecting your friendship, help and support. How are eating disorders treated? Treatment will be different depending on the type of eating disorder your friend or relative has. Talking therapies. It will usually involve some kind of talking therapy because help with eating and getting to a healthy weight, if needed, is usually not enough. Your friend or relative will talk to a therapist about the emotional difficulties that led to their eating disorder, and they will learn healthier ways to cope with these feelings. Their treatment may also involve them working through a guided self-help programme. Family therapy. Some people may also have family therapy, which is a type of group therapy. The person with the eating disorder is encouraged to work with family members to try to treat their eating disorder. Family therapy usually involves parents and siblings, but may sometimes include close friends or other family members. Length of treatment. Treatment will take place over several months, so your friend or relative can get used to the changes slowly . The earlier they start, the better their chances of making a good recovery. During their treatment, they will also have regular health checks to look after their physical health. Will they have to go into hospital? Most people with eating disorders will not have to stay in hospital. They are seen as outpatients, which means they visit the hospital for their appointments or any treatments. Some people who have a more advanced or serious eating disorder might need to visit the hospital for longer appointments as a day patient or be admitted to hospital for more intensive support and treatment (known as inpatient care). Should I visit them in hospital? This depends on what your friend or relative wants, how you feel and what the treatment centre allows. Let them know you're thinking of them and would like to visit. If this is not possible, you can always call, text or email them to let them know you're still there to support them. Can people be forced to get help for eating disorders? If your friend or relative has lost an extreme amount of weight, they may be in danger of starving themselves and developing serious complications. They may not be able to think clearly because of the lack of food and may have to be forced into life-saving treatment. In these circumstances, their doctor may decide to admit them to hospital for specialist treatment. This can only be done after the doctor has consulted with colleagues and they all agree with the doctor's decision. This is called being sectioned and is done under the rules of the Mental Health Act. The mental health charity Mind has more information about the Mental Health Act . Will they be cured when they come home? Your friend or relative will still need your support. Most people with an eating disorder do recover and learn to use more positive ways of coping. But recovery from an eating disorder can be very difficult and take a long time. Your friend or relative may even relapse into old behaviours, or have periods of living with their illness again during their recovery. Part of them may want to get better, while the other part might be very scared about giving up the eating disorder. They might think: ""I want to get better but I do not want to lose or put on any weight."" They will probably have good days and bad days. During times of stress, the eating difficulties may be more likely to return. Changing the way people with eating disorders think and feel is never easy, and it takes time."

If someone needs urgent medical help, go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111 for advice."
"Treatment - Anorexia nervosa. Treatment for anorexia nervosa (often called anorexia) usually involves a combination of talking therapy and supervised weight gain. It's important to start treatment as early as possible to reduce the risk of serious complications, particularly if you've already lost a lot of weight. If a GP thinks you may have anorexia, or another eating disorder, they’ll usually refer you to a specialist eating disorder team or community mental health team. Treatment for anorexia is slightly different for those under 18 years old. Young people are usually referred to children and young people’s mental health (CYPMH) services, or to a children’s health team in hospital (paediatrics). If you’re very unwell, you may need hospital treatment. Treatment for adults. A number of different talking therapies are available to treat anorexia. The aim of these treatments is to help you understand your eating problems and feel more comfortable with food so you can begin to eat more and reach a healthy weight. You may be offered any of the following types of talking therapy. If you feel one is not right for you or is not helping, you can talk to your doctors about trying a different kind of therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If you are offered CBT , it'll usually involve weekly sessions for up to 40 weeks (9 to 10 months), and 2 sessions a week in the first 2 to 3 weeks. CBT involves talking to a therapist who'll work with you to create a personalised treatment plan. They'll help you to: cope with your feelings. understand nutrition and the effects of starvation. make healthy food choices. They'll ask you to practise these techniques on your own, measure your progress, and show you ways to manage difficult feelings and situations so you stick with your new eating habits. Maudsley anorexia nervosa treatment for adults (MANTRA). MANTRA involves talking to a therapist in order to understand your eating disorder and its effects. It focuses on what's important to you and helps you to change your behaviour when you're ready. You can involve your family or carers if you think it would be helpful. You should be offered 20 sessions. The first 10 should be weekly, with the next 10 scheduled to suit you. Specialist supportive clinical management (SSCM). SSCM involves talking to a therapist who'll help you understand your eating disorder, any problems it's causing and what to do about them. You'll learn about nutrition and how your eating habits cause your symptoms. You should be offered 20 or more weekly sessions. Your therapist will set you a target weight and, over the course of the 20 weeks, will help you reach it. Focal psychodynamic therapy. Focal psychodynamic therapy is usually offered if you do not feel any of the above therapies are right for you or if they do not work. Focal psychodynamic therapy should include trying to understand how your eating habits are related to what you think, and to how you feel about yourself and other people in your life. You should be offered weekly sessions for up to 40 weeks (9 to 10 months). Nutritional support. During your treatment you'll get specialist dietary advice and a meal plan to help you get to a healthy weight. However, this advice alone will not help you recover from anorexia, so you'll need to have talking therapy as well as a meal plan. Your doctors will probably also advise you to take vitamin and mineral supplements so you get all the nutrients you need to be healthy. You'll usually have regular check-ups to see how you're getting on. If you’re very unwell, your meal plan may need to be supervised more closely. For some people this might mean a stay in hospital. Treatment for children and young people. Children and young people will usually be offered family therapy. You may also be offered adolescent-focused psychotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . CBT will be very similar to the CBT offered to adults but also includes some family sessions. Family therapy. Family therapy involves you and your family talking to a therapist, exploring how anorexia has affected you and how your family can support you to get better. Your therapist will also help you find ways to manage difficult feelings and situations to stop you from relapsing into unhealthy eating habits once your therapy ends. You'll have sessions together with your family, and the option to have some sessions on your own with the therapist. Family therapy is sometimes offered in a group with other families. You'll usually be offered 18 to 20 sessions over a year, and your therapist will regularly check that the schedule is still working for you. Adolescent-focused psychotherapy. Adolescent-focused psychotherapy will usually involve up to 40 one-to-one sessions, and normally lasts between 12 and 18 months. You'll have sessions more often in the beginning to give you more support. The therapist will help you: cope with your fears about gaining weight. understand nutrition and healthy eating, and the effects of undereating. understand your feelings about your identity and how you see yourself. build your confidence and help you manage stressful situations. You can also have 8 to 12 therapy sessions with your family. Nutritional support. If you have anorexia, you may not be getting all the vitamins and energy that your body needs to grow and develop properly, which is especially important as you reach puberty. During your treatment, your doctor will give you advice about the best foods to eat to stay healthy. They'll probably also advise you to take vitamin and mineral supplements. They'll also talk to your parents or carers about your diet so they can support you at home. You’ll usually have regular check-ups to see how you’re getting on. If you’re very unwell, your meal plan may need to be supervised more closely. For some people this might mean a stay in hospital. Bone health. Anorexia can make your bones weaker, which can make you more likely to develop a condition called osteoporosis . This is more likely if your weight has been low for a year or more in children and young people, or 2 years or more in adults. Because of this, your doctors may suggest you have a bone-density scan to check the health of your bones. Girls and women are more at risk of getting weak bones than men, so your doctor may prescribe you medicine to help protect your bones against osteoporosis. Antidepressants. Antidepressants are not used to treat anorexia. But you may be offered an antidepressant, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), in combination with therapy, to help you manage other mental health conditions such as: anxiety. depression. social phobia. Antidepressants are very rarely prescribed for children or young people under 18. Where treatment will happen. Most people with anorexia will be able to stay at home during their treatment. You'll usually have appointments at your clinic and then be able to go home. However, you may be admitted to hospital, or have day care in a hospital or at home, if you have serious health complications. For example, if: you're very underweight and still losing weight. you're very ill and your life is at risk. you're under 18 and your doctors believe you do not have enough support at home. doctors are worried that you might harm yourself or are at risk of suicide. Your doctors will keep a careful eye on your weight and health. They'll help you to reach a healthy weight gradually, and either start or continue any therapy. Once they're happy with your weight, as well as your physical and mental health, you should be able to return home or to stop having day care. Compulsory treatment. Occasionally, someone with anorexia may refuse treatment even though they're seriously ill and their life is at risk. In these cases, doctors may decide, as a last resort, to admit the person to hospital for compulsory treatment under the Mental Health Act. This is sometimes known as ""sectioning"" or ""being sectioned"". Check-ups. It's important that you receive ongoing support after your treatment is finished. You should have checks of your weight at least once a year, as well as of your mental and physical health. This will usually be done by your GP, but it may be with an eating disorder specialist. Further support. There are many organisations that support people with anorexia and their families, including: Talk ED. Beat. Mental Health Foundation. Mind. Joining a self-help support group, such as the Beat online support groups (called swan groups) for people with anorexia, may also be helpful."
"Returning to work after mental health issues. If you've had a mental health problem and been off or out of work, you may worry about going back. You may be concerned about how your colleagues will react, for example, or that you will not be able to cope. But many people find that going back to work is a positive step, and support is available to help ease your way back in. Going back to work after taking sick leave. If your job is still open for you, consider talking to a GP before going back to work. Then you can arrange a meeting with your employer or occupational health adviser. You can discuss anything that concerns you about returning to work, including any recommendations from the GP. You may wish to ask about: flexible hours – you might like to return part-time, for example, or start later in the day if you're sleepy from medicine in the mornings. support from a colleague in the short or long term. a place you can go for a break when needed. Support for people with mental health problems. Reasonable adjustments. By law, employers must make ""reasonable adjustments"" for workers with disabilities or long-term physical or mental conditions. This could mean giving someone with social anxiety their own desk rather than expecting them to hot desk, for example. Access to Work. If you need extra help beyond reasonable adjustments, you can apply for an Access to Work grant. These pay for practical support so you can carry on doing your job or start a new one. Looking for a new job. If you're unemployed and want to get back into work, staff at your local Jobcentre Plus can help. If you have ongoing mental health issues, ask to speak to their disability employment adviser. If you have a mental health worker, they can also tell you about the support available to help people with mental health problems get back to work. Before you speak to anyone, think about: where you would like to work. what kind of work you would like to do. what type of support you may need. your financial situation, including any benefits you're getting. A full-time paid job is not the only option open to you. There are other possibilities that may suit you, including part-time work or volunteering. Volunteering. Volunteering is a popular way of getting back into work. Helping other people in need is great for your self-esteem and can take your mind off your own worries. Plus, volunteer work can improve your chances of getting a paid job when you're ready and, until then, you can carry on claiming your benefits. Your rights and the law. Some people worry that when they apply for a job, they will be discriminated against if they admit that they have, or have had, mental or emotional health problems. But it's illegal for employers to discriminate against people with any kind of disability. Disabilities include mental health issues if they have a substantial and long-term effect on your ability to do normal daily activities. Employers can only ask about your health or disabilities if they need to find out if you'll be able to do necessary parts of the job, or for reasons such as offering you reasonable adjustments for the interview. You do not usually have to answer health questions before you're offered a job. How work benefits your mental health. Going back to work after a period of mental illness can be a positive experience if you have the right support. Among other things, work can give you: a sense of identity and purpose. the chance to build new friendships. better financial security. the feeling that you're playing an active part in society. More information. GOV.UK has advice on when a mental health condition becomes a disability. See tips on returning to work on the Mind website. See advice about getting a job if you have a mental health condition on the Rethink Mental Illness website."
"Bullying at work. How to identify if you're being bullied at work, how to stop it, and advice on getting support. What is workplace bullying? Bullying can involve arguments and rudeness, but it can also be more subtle. Other forms of bullying include: excluding and ignoring people and their contribution. overloading people with work. spreading malicious rumours. unfair treatment. picking on or regularly undermining someone. denying someone's training or promotion opportunities. using social media to humiliate, threaten or offend. Bullying can also happen in emails or on phone calls. What effect does it have? Bullying can make working life miserable. You can lose all faith in yourself, you can feel ill and depressed , and find it hard to motivate yourself to work. Bullying is not always a case of someone picking on the weak. Sometimes a person's strengths in the workplace can make the bully feel threatened, and that triggers their behaviour. What can I do? Do not be ashamed to tell people what's going on. Bullying is serious, and you need to let people know what's happening so they can help you. By sharing your experiences you may discover that it's happening to other people, too. Get advice. Speak to someone about how you might deal with the problem informally. This person could be: an employee representative, such as a trade union official. someone in the firm's human resources department. your manager or supervisor. Some employers have specially trained staff to help with bullying and harassment problems. They're sometimes called ""harassment advisers"". If the bullying is affecting your health, visit a GP. Stay calm. Recognise that criticism or personal remarks are not connected to your abilities. They reflect the bully's own weaknesses, and are meant to intimidate and control you. Stay calm, and do not be tempted to explain your behaviour. Ask them to explain theirs. Talk to the bully. The bullying may not be deliberate. If you can, talk to the person in question as they may not realise how their behaviour has affected you. Work out what to say beforehand. Describe what's been happening and why you object to it. Stay calm and be polite. If you do not want to talk to them yourself, ask someone else to do it for you. Keep a diary. This is known as a contemporaneous record. It will be very useful if you decide to take action at a later stage. Try to talk calmly to the person who's bullying you and tell them that you find their behaviour unacceptable. Often, bullies retreat from people who stand up to them. If necessary, have a colleague with you when you do this. Make a formal complaint. Making a formal complaint is the next step if you cannot solve the problem informally. To do this, you must follow your employer's grievance procedure. What about legal action? Sometimes the problem continues even after you've followed your employer's grievance procedure. If nothing is done to put things right, you can consider legal action, which may mean going to an employment tribunal. Get professional advice before taking this step. Find out more about the law covering workplace bullying from GOV.UK: workplace bullying and harassment . Where can I get help? Let your manager or union or staff representative know of the problem, or seek advice elsewhere, such as: Acas helpline. Citizens Advice: If you're being harassed or bullied at work. Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)."

"Overview - Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition. It causes a range of different psychological symptoms. Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a type of psychosis . This means the person may not always be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality. Symptoms of schizophrenia can include: hallucinations – hearing or seeing things that do not exist outside of the mind. delusions – unusual beliefs not based on reality. muddled thoughts and speech based on hallucinations or delusions. losing interest in everyday activities. not wanting to look after yourself and your needs, such as not caring about your personal hygiene. wanting to avoid people, including friends. feeling disconnected from your feelings or emotions.

If you're experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see a GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the better. There's no single test for schizophrenia. It's usually diagnosed after an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist. Causes of schizophrenia. The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. But most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It's thought that some people are more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia, and certain situations can trigger the condition such as a stressful life event or drug misuse. Treating schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medicine and therapy tailored to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . People with schizophrenia usually receive help from a community mental health team, which can offer day-to-day support and treatment, depending on the needs of each individual. Many people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help reduce the impact the condition has on daily life. Living with schizophrenia. If schizophrenia is well managed, it's possible to reduce the chance of severe relapses. This can include: recognising the signs of an acute episode. taking medicine as prescribed. talking to others about the condition. There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people find it comforting talking to others with a similar condition."
"Overview - Psychosis. Psychosis is when people lose some contact with reality. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations) and believing things that are not actually true (delusions). It may also involve confused (disordered) thinking and speaking. Symptoms of psychosis. The 3 main symptoms of psychosis are: hallucinations – where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that do not exist outside their mind but can feel very real to the person affected by them; a common hallucination is hearing voices. delusions – where a person has strong beliefs that are not shared by others; a common delusion is someone believing there's a conspiracy to harm them. disordered thinking and speaking - a person's thoughts and ideas come very quickly, which can make their speech fast and confusing. The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. Experiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode. When to get medical advice. You should see a GP immediately if you're experiencing symptoms of psychosis.

Psychosis can also be triggered by: a traumatic experience. stress. drug misuse. alcohol misuse. side effects of prescribed medicine. a physical condition, such as a brain tumour or dementia. head injury. childbirth. How often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause. Treating psychosis. Treatment for psychosis can depend on the cause, but usually involves a combination of antipsychotic medicine – which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis. talking therapies – the 1-to-1 talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and family interventions (a form of therapy that may involve partners, family members and close friends) can be helpful. social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment or accommodation. Some people are recommended to take antipsychotics on a long-term basis (and possibly for the rest of their lives). Other people may be able to gradually reduce their dosage and then stop taking them altogether if there is a marked improvement in symptoms. Do not stop suddenly taking any prescribed medicines as this could trigger a relapse of your symptoms. If a person's psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. Annual health checks. If you have a severe mental illness, you can have a physical check-up at your GP surgery once a year. These can make a big difference to your health and wellbeing. Complications of psychosis. People with a history of psychosis are more likely than others to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both. Some people use these substances as a way of managing psychotic symptoms.

"Hallucinations and hearing voices. Hallucinations are where you hear, see, smell, taste or feel things that appear to be real but only exist in your mind.

"Symptoms - Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia changes how a person thinks and behaves. The condition may develop slowly. The first signs can be hard to identify as they often develop during the teenage years. Symptoms such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or changes in sleeping patterns can be mistaken for an adolescent ""phase"". People often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia. Positive and negative symptoms. The symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into: positive symptoms – any change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions. negative symptoms – where people appear to withdraw from the world around then, take no interest in everyday social interactions, and often appear emotionless and flat. Hallucinations. Hallucinations are where someone sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels things that do not exist outside their mind. The most common hallucination is hearing voices . Hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations. Research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices. Some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they're rude, critical, abusive or annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer's thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or 1 place, such as the television. Delusions. A delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it's based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way the person behaves. Delusions can begin suddenly or may develop over weeks or months. Some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they're having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions. Someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe they're being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they're being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend. Some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street. Confused thinking and speech. People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme. People sometimes describe their thoughts as ""misty"" or ""hazy"" when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand. Some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else. Another feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions. These feelings of confusion may lead to a person's behaviour becoming more disorganised and unpredictable. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often appear several months or years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode with symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations These initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia. Symptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. It can be difficult to tell if these are symptoms of schizophrenia or something else . Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia can include: not wanting to look after themselves and their needs, such as not caring about personal hygiene. feeling disconnected from their feelings or emotions. wanting to avoid people, including friends. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family as they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness. Schizophrenia and psychosis. Schizophrenia is often described by doctors as a type of psychosis . A first acute episode of psychosis can be very difficult to cope with, both for the person who is ill and for their family and friends. Drastic changes in behaviour may occur, and the person can become upset, anxious, confused, angry or suspicious of those around them. But most people who get psychotic episodes are not a danger to others. They may not think they need help, and it can be hard to persuade them to visit a doctor."
"Causes - Schizophrenia. The exact causes of schizophrenia are unknown. Research suggests a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make a person more likely to develop the condition. Some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode. However, it's not known why some people develop symptoms while others do not. Increased risk. Genetics. Schizophrenia tends to run in families, but no single gene is thought to be responsible. It's more likely that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes does not necessarily mean you'll develop schizophrenia. Evidence that the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. Identical twins share the same genes. In identical twins, if a twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a 1 in 2 chance of developing it, too. This is true even if they're raised separately. In non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when a twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a 1 in 8 chance of developing the condition. While this is higher than in the general population, where the chance is about 1 in 100, it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia. Differences in brain development. Studies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains. These changes are not seen in everyone with schizophrenia and can occur in people who do not have a mental illness. But they suggest schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain. Neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. It is thought people with schizophrenia may have different amounts of certain neurotransmitters in their brains. Medicines that help lower the amounts of certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, can help with the symptoms of schizophrenia in some people. This suggests neurotransmitters play a role in the development of schizophrenia. Pregnancy and birth complications. Research has shown people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as: a low birthweight. premature labour. a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during birth. It may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development. Triggers. Triggers are things that can cause schizophrenia to develop in people who are at risk. These include: Stress. The main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as: bereavement. losing your job or home. divorce. the end of a relationship. physical, sexual or emotional abuse. These kinds of experiences, although stressful, do not cause schizophrenia. However, they can trigger its development in someone already vulnerable to it. Drug abuse. Studies have shown using drugs, particularly cannabis, cocaine, LSD or amphetamines, can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, psychosis or a similar illness. It is not clear if using drugs directly causes symptoms in people who are susceptible to schizophrenia, or if they are more likely to use drugs. If people have previously had episodes of psychosis or schizophrenia, using drugs can cause a relapse or stop symptoms from getting better. Research has shown that teenagers and young adults who use cannabis regularly are more likely to develop schizophrenia in later adulthood. The risk may be higher when using stronger forms of cannabis. Want to know more? Mind: How can recreational drugs affect mental health? Mind: What causes schizophrenia?"
"Diagnosis - Schizophrenia. There's no single test for schizophrenia and the condition is usually diagnosed after assessment by a specialist in mental health. If you're concerned you may be developing symptoms of schizophrenia, see a GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the better. The GP will ask about your symptoms and check they're not the result of other causes, such as recreational drug use. Community mental health team. If a diagnosis of schizophrenia is suspected, the GP should refer you to your local community mental health team (CMHT). CMHTs are made up of different mental health professionals who support people with complex mental health conditions. A member of the CMHT team, usually a psychiatrist or a specialist nurse, will carry out a more detailed assessment of your symptoms. They'll also want to know your personal history and current circumstances. To make a diagnosis, most mental healthcare professionals use a diagnostic checklist. Schizophrenia can usually be diagnosed by checking that a person has the symptoms associated with schizophrenia while also making sure they are not being caused by any other condition. Related illnesses. Sometimes it might not be clear whether someone has schizophrenia. If you have other symptoms at the same time, a psychiatrist may have reason to believe you have a related mental illness, such as: bipolar disorder – people with bipolar disorder swing from periods of elevated moods and extremely active, excited behaviour (mania) to periods of deep depression; some people also hear voices or experience other kinds of hallucinations, or may have delusions. schizoaffective disorder – this is often described as a form of schizophrenia because its symptoms are similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness in its own right; it may occur just once in a person's life, or come and go and be triggered by stress. You may also be assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder , depression , anxiety and substance misuse. Getting help for someone else. As a result of their delusional thought patterns, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there's nothing wrong with them. It's likely someone who has had acute schizophrenic episodes in the past will have been assigned a care co-ordinator. If this is the case, contact the person's care co-ordinator to express your concerns. They may also have written instructions with advice about what a friend or loved one can do if a person becomes unwell. This is sometimes called a crisis plan. If someone is having an acute schizophrenic episode for the first time, it may be necessary for a friend, relative or another loved one to persuade them to visit their GP. In the case of a rapidly worsening schizophrenic episode, you may need to go to the accident and emergency (A&E) department, where a duty psychiatrist will be available. If a person who is having an acute schizophrenic episode refuses to get help, their nearest relative can request that a mental health assessment is carried out. The social services department of your local authority can advise how to do this. Find your local authority . In severe cases, people can be compulsorily detained in hospital for assessment and treatment under the Mental Health Act (2007). After diagnosis. If you or a friend or relative are diagnosed with schizophrenia, you may feel anxious about what will happen. You may be worried about the stigma attached to the condition, or feel frightened and withdrawn. It's important to remember that a diagnosis can be a positive step towards getting good, straightforward information about the illness and the kinds of treatment and services available. Diagnosing children and young people. Children and young people with a first episode of schizophrenia should be referred urgently to a specialist mental health service. This should be either children and young people's mental health services (CYPMHS) for those aged up to 17, or an early intervention service for those aged 14 years or over, that includes a consultant psychiatrist with training in children and young people's mental health. For more information, see the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people ."
"Overview - Bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that affects your moods, which can swing from 1 extreme to another. It used to be known as manic depression. Symptoms of bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder have episodes of: depression – feeling very low and lethargic. mania – feeling very high and overactive. Symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you're experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer). Depression. You may initially be diagnosed with clinical depression before you have a manic episode, after which you may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder . During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide. If you're feeling suicidal, call 999 or go to your nearest A&E department as soon as possible. If you're feeling very depressed, contact a GP, your care co-ordinator or get help from NHS 111 if you're not sure what to do. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans free on 116 123. You can talk to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Or visit the Samaritans website or email jo@samaritans.org . Mania. During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may: feel very happy. have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. spend large amounts of money on things you cannot afford and would not normally want. It's also common to: not feel like eating or sleeping. talk quickly. become annoyed easily. You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. But you may also experience symptoms of psychosis , where you see or hear things that are not there or become convinced of things that are not true. Treatments for bipolar disorder. The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life. But there are several options for treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible. The following treatment options are available: medicine to prevent episodes of mania and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers, and you take them every day on a long-term basis. medicine to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they happen. learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania. psychological treatment – such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships. lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep. It's thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder. Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers is also available from charities, support groups and associations. This includes self-help and learning to deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition. Bipolar disorder and pregnancy. Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. But specialist help is available if you need it. Find out more: Tommy's: bipolar disorder in pregnancy. Bipolar UK: bipolar disorder, pregnancy and childbirth. What causes bipolar disorder? The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, although it's believed a number of things can trigger an episode. These include: extreme stress. overwhelming problems. life-changing events. genetic and chemical factors. Who's affected. Bipolar disorder is fairly common, and around 1 in every 100 people will be diagnosed with it at some point in their life. Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder. The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes. Bipolar disorder and driving. If you have bipolar disorder, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) as it may affect your driving. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of bipolar disorder. care for someone regularly because they have bipolar disorder (including family members). Our guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support."
"Symptoms - Bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. These can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression). Episodes of mania and depression often last for several days or longer. Depression. During a period of depression, your symptoms may include: feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time. lacking energy. difficulty concentrating and remembering things. loss of interest in everyday activities. feelings of emptiness or worthlessness. feelings of guilt and despair. feeling pessimistic about everything. self-doubt. being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking. lack of appetite. difficulty sleeping. waking up early. suicidal thoughts. Mania. The manic phase of bipolar disorder may include: feeling very happy, elated or overjoyed. talking very quickly. feeling full of energy. feeling self-important. feeling full of great new ideas and having important plans. being easily distracted. being easily irritated or agitated. being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking. not feeling like sleeping. doing things that often have disastrous consequences – such as spending large sums of money on expensive and sometimes unaffordable items. making decisions or saying things that are out of character and that others see as being risky or harmful. Patterns of depression and mania. If you have bipolar disorder, you may have episodes of depression more regularly than episodes of mania, or vice versa. Between episodes of depression and mania, you may sometimes have periods where you have a ""normal"" mood. The patterns are not always the same and some people may experience: rapid cycling – where a person with bipolar disorder repeatedly swings from a high to a low phase quickly. mixed state – where a person with bipolar disorder experiences symptoms of depression and mania together; for example, overactivity with a depressed mood. If your mood swings last a long time but are not severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with a mild form of bipolar disorder called cyclothymia . Living with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a condition of extremes. A person with bipolar disorder may be unaware they're in the manic phase. After the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. But at the time, they may believe other people are being negative or unhelpful. Some people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others. The extreme nature of the condition means staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. There's also an increased risk of suicide. During episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that are not there (hallucinations). They may also believe things that seem irrational to other people (delusions). These types of symptoms are known as psychosis or a psychotic episode."
"Living with - Bipolar disorder. Although it's usually a long-term condition, effective treatments for bipolar disorder , combined with self-help techniques, can limit its impact on your everyday life. Stay active and eat well. Eating well and keeping fit can help reduce the symptoms of bipolar disorder, particularly the depressive symptoms. It may also give you something to focus on and provide a routine, which is important for many people. A healthy diet, combined with exercise, may also help limit weight gain, which is a common side effect of medical treatments for bipolar disorder. Some treatments also increase the risk of developing diabetes, or worsen the illness in people that already have it. Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising are an important way of limiting that risk. Read more information about managing your weight . Annual health check. You should have a check-up at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes . This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure and having any appropriate blood tests. Use self-management programmes. Self-management programmes aim to help you take an active part in your own recovery so you're not controlled by your illness. Bipolar UK run self-management courses that may be helpful. Talk about it. Some people with bipolar disorder find it easy to talk to family and friends about their condition and its effects. Other people find it easier to turn to charities and support groups. Many organisations run self-help groups that can put you in touch with other people with the condition. This enables you to share helpful ideas and helps you realise you're not alone in feeling the way you do. These organisations also provide online support in forums and blogs. Some useful charities, support groups and associations include: Bipolar UK. Carers UK. Mind. Rethink Mental Illness. Samaritans. SANE. Talking therapies are useful for managing bipolar disorder, particularly during periods of stability. Services that can help. You may be involved with many different services during treatment for bipolar disorder. Some are accessed through referral from your GP, others through your local authority. Community mental health teams (CMHT). These provide the main part of local specialist mental health services. They offer assessment, treatment and social care. Early intervention teams. These provide early identification and treatment if you have the first symptoms of psychosis. Your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team. Crisis services. Crisis services allow you to be treated at home, instead of in hospital, for a sudden episode. These are specialist mental health teams that can deal with crises that occur outside normal office hours. Acute day hospital. These are an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital. You can visit every day or as often as you need. Assertive outreach teams. These deliver intensive treatment and rehabilitation in the community, providing rapid help in a crisis. Staff often visit you at home and liaise with other services, such as your GP or social services. They can also help with practical problems, such as helping to find housing and work. Avoid drugs and alcohol. Some people with bipolar disorder use alcohol or illegal drugs to try to ease their distress. Both have well-known harmful physical and social effects, and are not a substitute for treatment and good healthcare. Some people with bipolar disorder find they can stop misusing alcohol and drugs once they're using effective treatment. Others may have separate but related problems of alcohol and drug misuse, which may need to be treated separately. Avoiding alcohol and illegal drugs is an important part of recovery from episodes of manic or depressive symptoms, and can help you gain stability.  Money and benefits. It's important to avoid too much stress , including work-related stress. If you're employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way, particularly if job pressure triggers your symptoms. Employers must make reasonable adjustments to make the employment of people with disabilities possible. This includes people with bipolar disorder. A range of benefits is available to you if you cannot work as a result of bipolar disorder. Find out more about the benefits you may be able to get: GOV.UK: Attendance Allowance. GOV.UK: Carer's Allowance. GOV.UK: Council Tax Reduction. GOV.UK: Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). GOV.UK: Housing Benefit. GOV.UK: Personal Independent Payment (PIP). GOV.UK: Statutory Sick Pay. Care and support: money, work and benefits. Living with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder. People living with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder can have a tough time. During episodes of illness, the personalities of people with bipolar disorder may change, and they may become abusive or even violent. Sometimes social workers and the police may become involved. Relationships and family life are likely to feel the strain. If you're the nearest relative of a person with bipolar disorder, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the person's interests. These include requesting that the local social services authority asks an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with bipolar disorder should be detained in hospital, also known as sectioning. You may feel at a loss if you're caring for someone with bipolar disorder. Finding a support group and talking to other people in a similar situation might help. If you're having relationship or marriage difficulties, you can contact specialist relationship counsellors, who can talk things through with you and your partner. Want to know more? social care and support guide. Relate: relationship advice. Dealing with suicidal feelings. Having suicidal thoughts is a common depressive symptom of bipolar disorder. Without treatment, these thoughts may get stronger. Some research has shown the risk of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 to 20 times greater than the general population. Studies have also shown that as many as half of all people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once. If you're feeling suicidal, call 999 or go to your nearest A&E department as soon as possible. If you're feeling very depressed, contact your GP and ask for an emergency appointment, or contact your care co-ordinator or local mental health crisis team as soon as possible. You could also call NHS 111 for an immediate assessment. If you cannot or do not want to contact these people, contact the Samaritans on 116 123. You can call them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website or email jo@samaritans.org . Self-harm. Self-harm is often a symptom of mental health problems like bipolar disorder. For some people, self-harm is a way of gaining control over their lives or temporarily distracting themselves from mental distress. It may not be related to suicide or attempted suicide.

"Treatment - Bipolar disorder. Treatment for bipolar disorder aims to reduce the severity and number of episodes of depression and mania to allow as normal a life as possible. Treatment options for bipolar disorder. If a person is not treated, episodes of bipolar-related mania can last for between 3 and 6 months. Episodes of depression tend to last longer, often 6 to 12 months. But with effective treatment, episodes usually improve. Most people with bipolar disorder can be treated using a combination of different treatments. These can include 1 or more of the following: medicine to prevent episodes of mania and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers, and you take them every day on a long-term basis. medicine to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they happen. learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania. psychological treatment – such as talking therapies, which help you deal with depression and provide advice on how to improve relationships. lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, and advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep. Most people with bipolar disorder can receive most of their treatment without having to stay in hospital. But hospital treatment may be needed if your symptoms are severe or you're being treated under the Mental Health Act, as there's a danger you may self-harm or hurt others. In some circumstances, you could have treatment in a day hospital and return home at night. Medicines for bipolar disorder. Several medicines are available to help stabilise mood swings. These are commonly called mood stabilisers and include: lithium. anticonvulsant medicines. antipsychotic medicines. If you're already taking medicine for bipolar disorder and you develop depression, your GP will check you're taking the correct dose. If you're not, they'll change it. Episodes of depression are treated slightly differently in bipolar disorder, as taking antidepressants alone may lead to a relapse. Most guidelines suggest depression in bipolar disorder can be treated with just a mood stabiliser. But antidepressants are commonly used alongside a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic. If your GP or psychiatrist recommends you stop taking bipolar disorder medicine, the dose should be gradually reduced over at least 4 weeks, and up to 3 months if you're taking an antipsychotic or lithium. If you have to stop taking lithium for any reason, talk to your GP about taking an antipsychotic or valproate instead. Lithium. In the UK, lithium is the main medicine used to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium is a long-term treatment for episodes of mania and depression. It's usually prescribed for at least 6 months. If you're prescribed lithium, stick to the prescribed dose and do not stop taking it suddenly unless told to by your doctor. For lithium to be effective, the dosage must be correct. If it's incorrect, you may get side effects such as diarrhoea and getting sick. Tell your doctor immediately if you have side effects while taking lithium. You'll need regular blood tests at least every 3 months while taking lithium. This is to make sure your lithium levels are not too high or too low. Your kidney and thyroid function will also need to be checked, usually every 6 months. While you're taking lithium, avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen , unless they're prescribed by your GP. In the UK, lithium and the antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole are currently medicines that are officially approved for use in teenagers with bipolar disorder. But the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says that other bipolar medicines may be prescribed for children if recommended by their doctor. Anticonvulsant medicines. Anticonvulsant medicines include: carbamazepine. lamotrigine. valproate. These medicines are sometimes used to treat episodes of mania. They're also long-term mood stabilisers. Anticonvulsant medicines are often used to treat epilepsy , but they're also effective in treating bipolar disorder. A single anticonvulsant medicine may be used, or they may be used in combination with lithium when bipolar disorder does not respond to lithium on its own. Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is usually only prescribed on the advice of an expert in bipolar disorder. To begin with, the dose will be low and then gradually increased. Your progress will be carefully monitored if you're taking other medication, including the contraceptive pill. Blood tests to check your liver and kidney function will be carried out regularly. You'll also need to have regular blood count tests, and you may also have your weight and height monitored. Lamotrigine If you're prescribed lamotrigine , you'll usually be started on a low dose, which will be increased gradually. See your GP straight away if you're taking lamotrigine and develop a rash. You'll need to have an annual health check, but other tests are not usually needed. Women who are taking the contraceptive pill should talk to their GP about switching to a different method of contraception. Valproate Valproate is not usually prescribed if you're aged under 55. This is because there's a risk it can cause developmental problems in babies if you take it while you're pregnant. A specialist may still decide to treat your bipolar disorder using valproate if you're aged under 55, you've been assessed and there's no alternative treatment. Your specialist will need to check you're using reliable contraception and will advise you on the risks of taking the medicine if you're pregnant. Antipsychotic medicines. Antipsychotic medicines are sometimes prescribed to treat episodes of mania. They include: haloperidol. olanzapine. quetiapine. risperidone. They may also be used as a long-term mood stabiliser. Quetiapine may also be used for long-term bipolar depression. As antipsychotics can cause side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, constipation and weight gain, the initial dose will usually be low. If you're prescribed an antipsychotic medicine, you'll need to have regular health checks at least every 3 months, but possibly more often, particularly if you have diabetes. If your symptoms do not improve, you may be offered lithium or valproate as well. Rapid cycling. You will be prescribed a mood stabiliser or combination of mood stabilisers if you experience rapid cycling, where you quickly change from highs to lows without a ""normal"" period in between. But you will not usually be prescribed an antidepressant unless an expert in bipolar disorder has recommended it. Learning to recognise triggers. If you have bipolar disorder, you can learn to recognise the warning signs of an approaching episode of mania or depression. A community mental health worker, such as a psychiatric nurse, may be able to help you identify your early signs of relapse from your history. This will not prevent the episode occurring, but it'll allow you to get help in time. This may mean making some changes to your treatment, perhaps by adding an antidepressant or antipsychotic medicine to the mood-stabilising medication you're already taking. Your GP or specialist can advise you on this. Psychological treatment. Some people find psychological treatment helpful when used alongside medicine in between episodes of mania or depression. This may include: psychoeducation – to find out more about bipolar disorder. cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – this is most useful when treating depression. family therapy – a type of talking therapy that focuses on family relationships (such as marriage) and encourages everyone within the family or relationship to work together to improve mental health. Pregnancy and bipolar medicines. One of the main problems is that the risks of taking bipolar medicines during pregnancy are not well understood. If you're thinking about having a baby, it's important to talk to your GP or mental health team about taking bipolar medicines during pregnancy. If you're pregnant and you have bipolar disorder, a written plan for your treatment should be developed as soon as possible. The plan should be drawn up with you, your partner, your obstetrician (pregnancy specialist), midwife, GP and health visitor. Some medicines, such as valproate, are not routinely prescribed for pregnant women with bipolar disorder, as they may harm the baby. If you become pregnant while taking medicine that's been prescribed for bipolar disorder, it's important that you do not stop taking it until you have discussed it with your doctor. If bipolar medicine is prescribed for bipolar disorder after the baby's born, it may also affect your decision whether to breastfeed. Your pharmacist, midwife or mental health team can give you advice based on your circumstances."
"Causes - Bipolar disorder. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Experts believe there are a number of factors that work together to make a person more likely to develop it. These are thought to be a complex mix of physical, environmental and social factors. Genetics. It's thought bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as it seems to run in families. The family members of a person with bipolar disorder have an increased risk of developing it themselves. But no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder. Instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to act as triggers. Triggers. A stressful circumstance or situation often triggers the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Examples of stressful triggers include: the breakdown of a relationship. physical, sexual or emotional abuse. the death of a close family member or loved one. These types of life-altering events can cause episodes of depression at any time in a person's life. Bipolar disorder may also be triggered by: physical illness. sleep disturbances. overwhelming problems in everyday life, such as problems with money, work or relationships. Chemical imbalance in the brain. There is some evidence that bipolar disorder may be associated with chemical imbalances in the brain. The chemicals responsible for controlling the brain's functions are called neurotransmitters, and include noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine. There's some evidence that if there's an imbalance in the levels of 1 or more neurotransmitters, a person may develop some symptoms of bipolar disorder . For example, there's evidence that episodes of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline are too high, and episodes of depression may be the result of noradrenaline levels becoming too low."
"Diagnosis - Bipolar disorder. If your GP thinks you may have bipolar disorder, they'll usually refer you to a psychiatrist, a doctor who specialises in mental health problems. If your illness puts you at risk of harming yourself, your GP will arrange an appointment immediately. Specialist assessment. You'll be assessed by the psychiatrist at your appointment. They'll ask you a few questions to find out if you have bipolar disorder. If you do, they'll decide what treatments are most suitable. During the assessment, you'll be asked about your symptoms and when you first experienced them. The psychiatrist will also ask about how you feel leading up to and during an episode of mania or depression, and if you have thoughts about harming yourself. The psychiatrist will also want to know about your medical background and family history, especially whether any of your relatives have had bipolar disorder. Other tests. Depending on your symptoms, you may also need tests to see whether you have a physical problem, such as an underactive thyroid or an overactive thyroid . If you have bipolar disorder, you'll need to visit your GP regularly for a physical and mental health review. Advanced directives. If you're diagnosed with the condition, it's important to talk to your psychiatrist so you're fully involved in the decisions about your treatment and care. But a person is sometimes not able to make an informed decision about their care or communicate their needs, especially if their symptoms become severe. If this happens, it may be possible to draw up an advance statement . An advance statement is a set of written instructions that state what treatments and help you want (or do not want) in advance in case you cannot communicate your decisions at a later stage. Your GP or psychiatrist can give you further help and advice."
"Annual health check for people with severe mental health conditions. If you have schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or psychosis, your GP surgery should invite you to have an annual health check. During your health check the doctor or nurse will be able to look for any health problems, to help you get the treatment you need to stay well. You can ask them questions about your health and tell them how you are feeling. You can also talk about any treatment you are having or medicines you take. You may be able to get a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, COVID-19 booster or flu vaccine when you have your health check. Ask about vaccinations when you make your appointment. Who can have an annual health check. Anyone aged 18 or over who has schizophrenia , bipolar disorder or psychosis can have a free health check once a year. How to get an appointment. If you are eligible, you should get a letter from your GP surgery inviting you for an annual health check. You can contact your GP surgery to ask for an appointment if you have not received a letter. A family member or friend can contact the surgery for you if you prefer. If you're in regular contact with your mental health team, they can do the health check for you. If you have not had your annual health check yet, contact the care co-ordinator in your mental health team and ask how to book an appointment. How having an annual health check can help. It is up to you to decide if you want to have an annual health check, but these checks can make a big difference to your health and wellbeing. Talking to a doctor or nurse, and having a few simple tests, helps them find any health problems early. This means they can give you the treatment or support you need to stay well. You can ask the doctor or nurse for more information about annual health checks before you decide. What happens during the annual health check. Your appointment will take about 45 minutes. Before you have the health check and any tests, the doctor or nurse will check you are happy to go ahead. The doctor or nurse will usually: do a physical check-up, including weight, heart rate and blood pressure. ask you to pee in a small pot so they can check it for signs of some health problems. ask you to have a blood test. talk to you about staying well and ask if you need any help with this. talk to you about your medicines and ask if you have any side effects. check if your vaccinations are up to date. check how you are coping if you have a condition such as asthma or diabetes. They will also ask if you are OK (give your consent ) to share your health information with other health services, such as your mental health team. This is to make sure you get the right support if you need further care. The doctor or nurse can also give you health information, such as advice on healthy eating, exercise, alcohol or stopping smoking. They may offer you a follow-up appointment to give you further information and support. This can help you improve your health and wellbeing, and manage any health conditions you may have. If you need any additional support. The NHS has to make it easy for everyone to use health services, including anyone who needs additional support. This is called making ""reasonable adjustments"". Tell your GP surgery if you need any extra help, such as: a longer appointment or having a carer, friend or peer support worker with you. an appointment at the beginning or end of the day, or a quiet place to wait if you find it hard to be in a busy waiting room. additional reassurance or support if you are afraid of needles and are having a blood test or vaccine. a sign-language service. transport if you need help getting to the GP surgery. a home visit if you are unable to leave your home. If you need additional support, this will usually be written in a health profile or health action plan that the doctor or nurse can use. Is it the same as the NHS Health Check? The annual health check for people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or psychosis is not the same as the NHS Health Check for all adults aged 40 to 74. The standard NHS Health Check is done every 5 years and checks your risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, diabetes and dementia."
"Self-help therapies. Self-help therapies are psychological therapies that you can do in your own time to help with problems like stress, anxiety and depression.

"Counselling. Counselling is a talking therapy that involves a trained therapist listening to you and helping you find ways to deal with emotional issues. Sometimes the term ""counselling"" is used to refer to talking therapies in general, but counselling is also a type of therapy in its own right. What can counselling help with? Counselling can help you cope with: a mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety or an eating disorder. an upsetting physical health condition, such as infertility. a difficult life event, such as a bereavement, a relationship breakdown or work-related stress. difficult emotions – for example, low self-esteem or anger. other issues, such as sexual identity. What to expect from counselling. At your appointment, you'll be encouraged to talk about your feelings and emotions with a trained therapist, who'll listen and support you without judging or criticising. The therapist can help you gain a better understanding of your feelings and thought processes, and find your own solutions to problems. But they will not usually give advice or tell you what to do. Counselling can take place: face to face. in a group. over the phone. by email. online through live chat services (learn more about online tools for mental health). You may be offered a single session of counselling, a short course of sessions over a few weeks or months, or a longer course that lasts for several months or years. It can take a number of sessions before you start to see progress, but you should gradually start to feel better with the help and support of your therapist. Can you get free counselling on the NHS? You can get free talking therapies, including counselling for depression, on the NHS. You do not need a referral from a GP. You can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service.

Reputable therapists will be registered with a professional organisation that's been accredited by the Professional Standards Authority (PSA) . This means they have met the PSA's required professional standards to practise. Other talking therapies.

It's often related to feeling like you're losing control over something, but sometimes there's no obvious cause. When you're feeling anxious or scared, your body releases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. This can be helpful for some people and stress might help you get things done or feel more motivated. But it might also cause physical symptoms such as a faster heartbeat or sweating. If you're stressed all the time it can become a problem. Identifying the cause. If you know what's causing your stress it might be easier to find ways to manage it. Some examples of things that may cause stress include: work – feeling pressure at work, unemployment or retirement. family – relationship difficulties, divorce or caring for someone. financial problems – unexpected bills or borrowing money. health – illness, injury or losing someone (bereavement). Even significant life events such as buying a house, having a baby or planning a wedding could lead to feelings of stress. You might find it hard to explain to people why you feel this way, but talking to someone could help you find a solution."

"Loneliness in older people. Older people are especially vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation – and it can have a serious effect on health. But there are ways to overcome loneliness, even if you live alone and find it hard to get out. Hundreds of thousands of elderly people are lonely and cut off from society in this country, especially those over the age of 75. According to Age UK, more than 2 million people in England over the age of 75 live alone, and more than a million older people say they go over a month without speaking to a friend, neighbour or family member. People can become socially isolated for a variety of reasons, such as getting older or weaker, no longer being the hub of their family, leaving the workplace, the deaths of spouses and friends, or through disability or illness. Whatever the cause, it's shockingly easy to be left feeling alone and vulnerable, which can lead to depression and a serious decline in physical health and wellbeing. Someone who's lonely probably also finds it hard to reach out. There's a stigma surrounding loneliness, and older people tend not to ask for help because they have too much pride. It's important to remember loneliness can – and does – affect anyone, of any age. Here are ways for older people to connect with others, and feel useful and appreciated again. Smile, even if it feels hard. Grab every chance to smile at others or begin a conversation – for instance, with the cashier at the shop or the person next to you in the GP waiting room. If you're shy or not sure what to say, try asking people about themselves. Invite friends for tea. If you're feeling down and alone, it's tempting to think nobody wants to visit you. But often friends, family and neighbours will appreciate receiving an invitation to come and spend some time with you. If you'd prefer for someone else to host, Re-engage is a charity that holds regular free Sunday afternoon tea parties for people over the age of 75 who live alone. You'll be collected from your home and driven to a volunteer host's home for the afternoon. Apply online or call Re-engage on 0800 716 543. Keep in touch by phone. Having a chat with a friend or relative over the phone can be the next best thing to being with them. Or you can call The Silver Line , a helpline for older people set up by Esther Rantzen, on 0800 470 8090. You can also call Independent Age on 0800 319 6789 or Age UK on 0800 678 1602. Learn to love computers. If your friends and family live far away, a good way to stay in touch, especially with grandchildren, is by using a personal computer, smartphone or tablet. You can share emails and photos with family and friends, have free video chats using services such as Skype , Zoom , FaceTime or Viber , and make new online ""friends"" or reconnect with old friends on social media sites such as Facebook , Instagram or Twitter and website forums. A smartphone or tablet can be especially useful if you can't get around very easily, as you can sit with it on your knee or close to hand and the screen is clear and bright. A sponge-tip stylus pen or speech recognition may help if the touchscreen is difficult for arthritic hands or fingers with poor circulation. Libraries and community centres often hold regular training courses for older people to learn basic computer skills – as well as being a good place to meet and spend time with others in their own right. Age UK has more advice about making the most of the internet . Get involved in local community activities. These will vary according to where you live, but the chances are you'll have access to a singing or walking group, book clubs, bridge, bingo, quiz nights and faith groups. Not to mention local branches of regional and national organisations that hold social events, such as the Women's Institute and Re-engage . The Silver Line helpline (0800 470 8090) can let you know what's going on in your local area. Fill your diary. It can help you feel less lonely if you plan the week ahead and put things in your diary to look forward to each day, such as a walk in the park or going to a local coffee shop, library, sports centre, cinema or museum. Independent Age has published a guide about what to do if you're feeling lonely, which includes tips about activities you could try.

Don't wait for people to come and see you – travel to visit them. One advantage of being older is that public transport is better value. Local bus travel is free for older people across England (though remoter areas may have more limited bus services). The age at which you can apply for your free bus pass depends on when you were born and where you live. Contact your local authority for more information on how to apply. Use this State Pension calculator to find out the exact date when you can apply for your free bus pass. For longer distances, you may be able to save money on train and coach travel by booking in advance online. If you do travel by train often then paying for a Senior Railcard may help you save money in the long-term. The Royal Voluntary Service can put you in touch with volunteers who provide free transport for older people with mobility issues or who live in rural areas with limited public transport. Help others. Use the knowledge and experience you have gained over a lifetime to give something back to your community. You'll get lots back in return, such as new skills and confidence – and, hopefully, some new friends, too. There are endless volunteering opportunities that relish the qualities and skills of older people, such as patience, experience and calmness. Examples are  Home-Start ,  Sure Start , helping in a local charity shop or hospital or with a school reading programme. You can also volunteer to help the Citizens Advice charity in a range of activities . Join the University of the Third Age. The University of the Third Age (U 3 A) operates in many areas, offering older people the chance to learn or do something new. Run by volunteers, U 3 A has no exams. Instead, it gives you the chance to do, play or learn something you may never have done before, or something you haven't considered since your school days. U 3 A is also a great place to meet people and make new friends."

"Overview - Post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia , and find concentrating difficult. These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person's day-to-day life. Causes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Any situation that a person finds traumatic can cause PTSD. These can include: serious road accidents. violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery. serious health problems. childbirth experiences. PTSD can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event, or it can occur weeks, months or even years later. PTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it's not clear exactly why some people develop the condition and others do not. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People who repeatedly experience traumatic situations, such as severe neglect, abuse or violence, may be diagnosed with complex PTSD. Complex PTSD can cause similar symptoms to PTSD and may not develop until years after the event. It's often more severe if the trauma was experienced early in life, as this can affect a child's development. When to get medical advice. It's normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but most people improve naturally over a few weeks. You should see a GP if you or your child are still having problems about 4 weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome. If necessary, your GP can refer you to mental health specialists for further assessment and treatment. How post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is treated. PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event. Any of the following treatment options may be recommended: watchful waiting – monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse without treatment. antidepressants – such as paroxetine or sertraline. talking therapies – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). You can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service. Find a talking therapies service Information: Social care and support guide. You can get support if: you need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. you care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled or because of their age, including family members."
"Complex PTSD - Post-traumatic stress disorder. You may have complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if you have some of the symptoms of PTSD, and also have problems with managing your emotions and having relationships. Symptoms of complex PTSD. The symptoms of complex PTSD are similar to symptoms of PTSD , but may also include: feelings of worthlessness, shame and guilt. problems controlling your emotions. finding it hard to feel connected with other people. relationship problems, like having trouble keeping friends and partners. Causes of complex PTSD. Complex PTSD may be caused by experiencing recurring or long-term traumatic events, for example: childhood abuse or neglect. domestic violence. sexual abuse. torture, sex trafficking, or slavery. war. You may also be more likely to develop complex PTSD if: you experienced trauma at a young age. you were harmed by someone close to you who you trusted. you were unable to escape the trauma. Treating complex PTSD. If you have complex PTSD, you may be offered therapies used to treat PTSD, such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). You'll also be offered treatment for other problems you may have, such as depression or alcohol addiction. You should be offered ongoing support after your treatment ends."
"Symptoms - Post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life. In most cases, the symptoms develop during the first month after a traumatic event. But in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear. Some people with PTSD experience long periods when their symptoms are less noticeable, followed by periods where they get worse. Other people have constant severe symptoms. The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below. Re-experiencing. Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly relives the traumatic event in the form of: flashbacks. nightmares. repetitive and distressing images or sensations. physical sensations, such as pain, sweating, feeling sick or trembling. Some people have constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them coming to terms with the event. For example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame. Avoidance and emotional numbing. Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of PTSD. This usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience. Many people with PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies. Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy. Hyperarousal (feeling ""on edge""). Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled. This state of mind is known as hyperarousal. Hyperarousal often leads to: irritability. angry outbursts. sleeping problems (insomnia). difficulty concentrating. Other problems. Many people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including: other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety or phobias. self-harming or destructive behaviour, such as drug misuse or alcohol misuse. other physical symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches. PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships. PTSD in children. PTSD can affect children as well as adults. Children with PTSD can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares . Like adults, children with PTSD may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, and may have physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches . Other symptoms you may notice in children with PTSD include: difficult behaviour. avoiding things related to the traumatic event. re-enacting the traumatic event again and again through their play. When to seek medical advice. It's normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally over a few weeks. You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about 4 weeks after the traumatic experience, or the symptoms are particularly troublesome. Your GP will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. They'll ask whether you have experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you have re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares. Your GP can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you'd benefit from treatment."
"Treatment - Post-traumatic stress disorder. The main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are talking therapies and medicine. Traumatic events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and getting professional help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD. It's possible for PTSD to be successfully treated many years after the traumatic event or events occurred, which means it's never too late to get help. Assessment. Before having treatment for PTSD, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs. This may be carried out by a GP or specialist. You can see a GP to start on this process, or you can refer yourself for assessment to a talking therapy service. You're likely to be offered treatment if you've had symptoms of PTSD for more than 4 weeks or your symptoms are severe. There are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as a psychological therapist, psychologist, community psychiatric nurse or psychiatrist. Active monitoring. If you have mild symptoms of PTSD, or you've had symptoms for less than 4 weeks, an approach called active monitoring may be recommended. Active monitoring involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse. It's sometimes recommended because 2 in every 3 people who develop problems after a traumatic experience get better within a few weeks without treatment. If active monitoring is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within 1 month. Talking therapies. If you have PTSD that requires treatment, talking therapies are usually recommended first. A combination of a talking therapy and medicine may be recommended if you have severe or persistent PTSD. A GP can refer you to an NHS talking therapies service or, in some cases, a specialist clinic. You can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Find an NHS talking therapies service There are 3 main types of talking therapies used to treat people with PTSD. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you manage problems by changing how you think and act. Trauma-focused CBT uses a range of psychological techniques to help you come to terms with the traumatic event. For example, your therapist may ask you to face your traumatic memories by describing aspects of your experience in detail. During this process, your therapist helps you cope with any distress you feel while identifying any beliefs you have about the experience that may be unhelpful. Your therapist can help you gain control of your fear and distress by reviewing with you any conclusions you have drawn about your experience (for example, feeling you're to blame for what happened, or fear that it may happen again). You may also be encouraged to gradually restart any activities you have avoided since your experience, such as driving a car if you had an accident. You'll usually have 8 to 12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused CBT, although fewer may be needed. Sessions usually last for around 60 to 90 minutes. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological treatment that's been found to reduce the symptoms of PTSD. It involves recalling the traumatic incident in detail while making eye movements, usually by following the movement of your therapist's finger. Other methods may include the therapist tapping their finger or playing sounds. It's not clear exactly how EMDR works, but it may help you change the negative way you think about a traumatic experience. Support and advice. There are a number of charities that provide peer support and advice for PTSD. For example: Combat Stress – a military charity specialising in helping ex-servicemen and women. Rape Crisis – a UK charity providing a range of services for women and girls who have experienced abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault. Victim Support – providing support and information to victims or witnesses of crime. CRUSE – a UK charity providing support and information for people who have experienced bereavement. Medicine. The 2 medicines recommended to treat PTSD in adults are paroxetine and sertraline . Paroxetine and sertraline are both a type of antidepressant known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . These medicines will only be used if: you choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment. psychological treatment would not be effective because there's an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence). you have gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment. you have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatment. Sometimes other antidepressants, such as venlafaxine , may be prescribed, but they are not licensed to treat PTSD. These medicines are not usually prescribed for people younger than 18 unless recommended by a specialist. If medicine for PTSD is effective, it'll usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of 4 weeks or longer. If a medicine is not effective at reducing your symptoms, your dosage may be increased. Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medicine is withdrawn. For example, common side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea. Possible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability. Withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medicine is reduced slowly. Children and young people. Trauma-focused CBT is usually recommended for children and young people with PTSD. This normally involves a course of 6 to 12 sessions that have been adapted to suit the child's age, circumstances and level of development. Where appropriate, treatment includes consulting with and involving the child's family. Children who do not respond to trauma-focused CBT may be offered EMDR. PTSD and driving. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may affect your ability to drive safely. Ask your GP whether you should inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about your condition."
"Causes - Post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience. Types of events that can lead to PTSD include: serious accidents. physical or sexual assault. abuse, including childhood or domestic abuse. exposure to traumatic events at work, including remote exposure. serious health problems, such as being admitted to intensive care. childbirth experiences, such as losing a baby. the death of someone close to you. war and conflict. torture. PTSD develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. It's not fully understood why some people develop the condition while others do not. But certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop PTSD. Who's at risk. If you have had depression or anxiety in the past, or you do not receive much support from family or friends, you may be more likely to develop PTSD after a traumatic event. There may also be a genetic factor involved in PTSD. For example, having a parent with a mental health problem is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition. Why does it develop? Although it's not clear exactly why people develop PTSD, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. Survival mechanism. One suggestion is that the symptoms of PTSD are the result of an instinctive mechanism intended to help you survive further traumatic experiences. For example, the flashbacks many people with PTSD experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you're better prepared if it happens again. The feeling of being ""on edge"" (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis. But while these responses may be intended to help you survive, they're actually very unhelpful in reality because you cannot process and move on from the traumatic experience. High adrenaline levels. Studies have shown that people with PTSD have abnormal levels of stress hormones. Normally, when in danger, the body produces stress hormones like adrenaline to trigger a reaction in the body. This reaction, often known as the ""fight or flight"" reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain. People with PTSD have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there's no danger. It's thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with PTSD. Changes in the brain. In people with PTSD, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans. One part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus. In people with PTSD, the hippocampus appears smaller in size. It's thought that changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks. The malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate does not reduce over time. Treatment of PTSD results in proper processing of the memories so, over time, the flashbacks and nightmares gradually disappear."
"Signs of an anxiety disorder. If you're experiencing symptoms of anxiety over a long period of time, you may have an anxiety disorder. For more information about symptoms, read anxiety, fear and panic . Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a long-term condition that can make you feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.

"Loneliness in older people: how to help. There are lots of ways you can do your bit to help lonely or socially isolated older people in your community. The person you're helping will reap health benefits, and you'll find you will as well. Volunteering for an organisation that supports older people is a key way of helping a lonely or socially isolated older person. But a simple friendly chat or phone call can make all the difference, too. Evidence suggests giving your time in this way could be as valuable to you as the person you support. It's likely to boost your self-esteem and sense of purpose. And helping others takes your mind off your own problems for a while. Read our 5 steps to mental wellbeing and where volunteering fits in Start a conversation. It's not always easy to know who or how to help. A good start is simply to stop and talk to an older neighbour if you pass them on the street. If you think an older person may have trouble hearing or has memory problems, make sure to speak clearly (but do not shout!). Pause between sentences and questions to give them chance to digest the information. And allow a little extra time for them to respond – do not hurry them. Offer practical help. Do you know an older person who lives alone, rarely leaves the house, has recently suffered a bereavement, is in poor health, disabled, has sight or hearing loss, or does not seem to have close family living nearby? Ask them if they need any help with tasks such as shopping, posting letters, picking up prescriptions and medicines, or dog-walking. Offer to accompany them or give them a lift to activities or doctors' and hospital appointments, the library, hairdressers or faith services. Share your time. Volunteer for organisations that support older people. These often offer ""befriending"" schemes for isolated older people, and rely on volunteers for one-to-one contact as a telephone ""buddy"", visitor or driver, or hosting social events for groups. Your contribution could be as simple as a weekly telephone call to an isolated older person, or extend to regular home visits for a chat and to help with shopping and so on, driving an older person to a social event, or even hosting coffee mornings for groups of older people. You can find more information on volunteering to befriend and support older people from these organisations: Age UK: volunteering to support your local Age UK. Independent Age: Volunteering with us. Royal Voluntary Service: Start your volunteering journey. Help with household tasks. Getting older can make it hard to tackle even simple jobs around the house. Older people often really appreciate any offer of help with basic chores such as taking out the rubbish, changing light bulbs, fastening sash windows, clearing snow off the path, putting up pictures, and so on. Share a meal. Older, isolated people often need a hand cooking for themselves, so why not take round an extra plate of hot home-cooked food, or a frozen portion they can heat up or microwave? As well as being practical, it's a nice way to share your time with a neighbour. Try to provide the meal in a container that you do not need back – it's hard work for both of you to keep track of serving bowls. Watch out for signs of winter illness. Older people are particularly vulnerable during the winter as cold weather increases their risk of illnesses, such as colds , coughs , flu , heart attacks , strokes , breathing problems and hypothermia (a dangerous fall in body temperature). Check (ideally in autumn or early winter) if they have had a free flu vaccine and, if not, offer to make an appointment at the GP surgery. Look out for signs of serious illness, such as drowsiness, slurred speech and the person not complaining of feeling cold even in a bitterly cold room. If you're worried, ask if there's a relative or close friend you can phone, or call their doctor or NHS 111 . You could also contact your local council or ring the Age UK helpline on 0800 678 1602.

"Coping with financial worries. Feeling low or anxious is a normal response when you've lost your job, been made redundant, or you're struggling with debt. You may be feeling, behaving or thinking in ways that are unfamiliar. But that does not necessarily mean you've got depression or an anxiety disorder . How to survive financial stress. Stay active. Keep seeing your friends, keep your CV up to date, and try to keep paying the bills. If you have more time because you're not at work, do some form of exercise – physical activity can improve your mood if you're feeling low. Get advice. If you're going into debt, get advice on how to prioritise your debts. When people feel anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to others. Some people can lose their confidence about driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing these situations will generally make them easier. Do not drink too much alcohol. For some people with money worries, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of dealing with your emotions or just to fill in time. But alcohol will not help you deal with your problems and could add to your stress. Do not give up your daily routine. Get up at your normal time and stick to your usual routine. If you lose your routine, it can affect your eating – you may stop cooking, miss breakfast because you're still in bed, or eat snacks instead of having proper meals. More help for money problems.

"How to help someone with depression. Feeling down or depressed from time to time is normal. But if these feelings last 2 weeks or more, or start to affect everyday life, this can be a sign of depression. Depression can develop slowly. Someone who's depressed does not always realise or acknowledge that they're not feeling or behaving as they usually do. Often it's a partner, family member or carer who first realises that help's needed. They may encourage their friend or relative to see a GP, or find some other source of support. Signs that someone may be depressed. Depression has lots of possible symptoms. You may notice that someone: has lost interest in doing things they normally enjoy. seems to be feeling down or hopeless. has slower speech and movements or is more fidgety and restless than usual. feels tired or does not have much energy. is overeating or has lost their appetite. is sleeping more than usual or is not able to sleep. has trouble concentrating on everyday things, such as watching TV or reading the paper. Signs of depression in older people. Signs of depression in older people can include: empty fridges and cupboards (which suggest a poor diet). neglected appearance. poor hygiene. someone showing little joy in receiving visitors. Tips to help someone who seems down. Let them know you care and are there to listen. Accept them as they are, without judging them. Gently encourage them to help themselves – for example, by staying physically active, eating a balanced diet and doing things they enjoy. Get information about the services available to them, such as an NHS talking therapy service or depression support groups in their area. Stay in touch with them by messaging, phoning or meeting for coffee. People who are depressed can become isolated and may find it difficult to leave their home. Try to be patient. Take care of yourself. When to get help urgently. If the person you're worried about expresses suicidal feelings, you or they should contact a GP or NHS 111 . You can also contact Samaritans on 116 123 for confidential 24-hour support."
"Symptoms - Depression in adults. The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page. Psychological symptoms. The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness. feeling hopeless and helpless. having low self-esteem. feeling tearful. feeling guilt-ridden. feeling irritable and intolerant of others. having no motivation or interest in things. finding it difficult to make decisions. not getting any enjoyment out of life. feeling anxious or worried. having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself. Physical symptoms. The physical symptoms of depression include: moving or speaking more slowly than usual. changes in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased). constipation. unexplained aches and pains. lack of energy. low sex drive (loss of libido). disturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning. Social symptoms. The social symptoms of depression include: avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities. neglecting your hobbies and interests. having difficulties in your home, work or family life. Severities of depression. Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong. Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are. how long depression lasts. the impact on your daily life. A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as ""manic depression"", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as ""winter depression"", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period. When to seek help. See a GP if you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day, every day, for more than 2 weeks. A low mood may improve after a short time."
"Symptoms - Psychosis. Someone who develops psychosis will have their own unique set of symptoms and experiences, according to their particular circumstances. But in general, 3 main symptoms are associated with a psychotic episode: hallucinations. delusions. confused and disturbed thoughts. Hallucinations. Hallucinations are where someone sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels things that do not exist outside their mind. sight – seeing colours, shapes or people. sounds – hearing voices or other sounds. touch – feeling touched when there is nobody there. smell – an odour that other people cannot smell. taste – a taste when there is nothing in the mouth. Delusions. A delusion is where a person has an unshakeable belief in something untrue. A person with persecutory delusions may believe an individual or organisation is making plans to hurt or kill them. A person with grandiose delusions may believe they have power or authority. For example, they may think they're the president of a country or they have the power to bring people back from the dead. People who have psychotic episodes are often unaware that their delusions or hallucinations are not real, which may lead them to feel frightened or distressed. Confused and disturbed thoughts. People with psychosis sometimes have disturbed, confused, and disrupted patterns of thought. Signs of this include: rapid and constant speech. disturbed speech – for example, they may switch from one topic to another mid-sentence. a sudden loss in their train of thought, resulting in an abrupt pause in conversation or activity. Postnatal psychosis. Postnatal psychosis, also called puerperal psychosis, is a severe form of postnatal depression , a type of depression some women experience after having a baby. It's estimated postnatal psychosis affects around 1 in every 1,000 women who give birth. It most commonly occurs during the first few weeks after having a baby. Postnatal psychosis is more likely to affect women who already have a mental health condition, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia . As well as the symptoms of psychosis, symptoms of postnatal psychosis can also include changes in mood: a high mood (mania) – for example, feeling elated, talking and thinking too much or too quickly. a low mood – for example, feeling sad, a lack of energy, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping. Contact a GP immediately if you think you or someone you know may have developed postnatal psychosis as it is a medical emergency. If this is not possible, call NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service . If you think there's an imminent danger of harm, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Psychosis is not the same as psychopath. The terms ""psychosis"" and ""psychopath"" should not be confused. Someone with psychosis has a short-term (acute) condition that, if treated, can often lead to a full recovery. A psychopath is someone with an antisocial personality disorder , which means they: lack empathy – the capacity to understand how someone else feels. are manipulative. often have a total disregard for the consequences of their actions. People with an antisocial personality can sometimes pose a threat to others because they can be violent. Most people with psychosis are more likely to harm themselves than others."
"Overview - Postnatal depression. Postnatal depression is a type of depression that many parents experience after having a baby. It's a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 women within a year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners. It's important to get help as soon as possible if you think you might be depressed, as your symptoms could last for months or get worse and have a significant impact on you, your baby and your family. With the right support most people make a full recovery. Information: Depression during pregnancy. Depression in pregnancy (antenatal depression) is also common, affecting more than 1 in 10 women. Other mental health symptoms that can occur during or after your pregnancy include anxiety, panic attacks and psychosis. Symptoms of postnatal depression. Many women feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the "" baby blues "" and is so common that it's considered normal. The ""baby blues"" do not last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth. If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression. Postnatal depression can start any time in the first year after giving birth. Signs that you or someone you know might be depressed include: a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood. lack of enjoyment and loss of interest in the wider world. lack of energy and feeling tired all the time. trouble sleeping at night and feeling sleepy during the day. finding it difficult to look after yourself and your baby. withdrawing from contact with other people. problems concentrating and making decisions. frightening thoughts – for example, about hurting your baby. Many women do not realise they have postnatal depression because it can develop gradually. Non-urgent advice: Speak to a GP, midwife or health visitor as soon as possible if:. you think you may be depressed. Many midwives and health visitors have been trained to recognise postnatal depression and have techniques that can help. Remember that: a range of help and support is available, including talking therapy. depression is an illness like any other. it's not your fault you're depressed – it can happen to anyone. being depressed does not mean you're a bad parent. it does not mean you're going mad. your baby will not be taken away from you – babies are only taken into care in very exceptional circumstances. Treatments for postnatal depression. Postnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening, but support and effective treatments are available. These include: self-help – things you can try yourself include talking to your family and friends about your feelings and what they can do to help, making time for yourself to do things you enjoy, resting whenever you get the chance, getting as much sleep as you can at night, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. talking therapy – a GP may be able to recommend a self-help course or may refer you for a course of therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). antidepressants – these may be recommended if your depression is more severe or other treatments have not helped; your doctor can prescribe a medicine that's safe to take while breastfeeding. Local and national organisations, such as the Association for Post Natal Illness (APNI) and Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support (PANDAS) , can also be useful sources of help and advice. Causes of postnatal depression. The cause of postnatal depression is not completely clear. There are a number of things that may make you more likely to have postnatal depression. These include: a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life. a history of mental health problems during pregnancy. having no close family or friends to support you. a difficult relationship with your partner. recent stressful life events, such as a bereavement. physical or psychological trauma, such as domestic violence. Even if you do not have any of these, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression. It often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. Looking after a baby can be stressful and exhausting. Preventing postnatal depression. There are things you can do during pregnancy to help you keep well, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and having someone you can talk to and turn to for support. Going to antenatal classes and making friends with other pregnant women or new parents can also be helpful. If you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, talk to a GP or your mental health team if: you have a history of depression or mental health problems. someone in your family has had mental health problems after childbirth (for example, your mother or sister). This is so they can offer you appropriate treatment. You can also talk to a midwife, who can support you or refer you to specialist mental health services if needed. If you have had a mental health problem while pregnant, your doctor should arrange for you to be seen regularly in the first few weeks after birth. The mental health team, maternity team and GP will work closely with you during your pregnancy and after you have given birth. Myths about postnatal depression. Postnatal depression is often misunderstood and there are many myths surrounding it. These include: postnatal depression is less severe than other types of depression – in fact, it's as serious as other types of depression. postnatal depression is entirely caused by hormonal changes – it's actually caused by many different factors. postnatal depression will soon pass – unlike the ""baby blues"", postnatal depression can persist for months if left untreated and in a minority of cases it can become a long-term problem. postnatal depression only affects women – research has actually found that up to 1 in 10 new fathers become depressed after having a baby. These factors are equally true of antenatal depression. Information: Further information."
"Symptoms - Postnatal depression. Common symptoms of postnatal depression. The main symptoms include: feeling sad, low in mood or tearful much of the time. feeling agitated or irritable towards your partner, baby or other children. loss of interest in the world around you and no longer enjoying things that used to give you pleasure (like you ""cannot be bothered""). lack of energy and feeling tired all the time. trouble sleeping at night – you may be awake even when your baby is sleeping. feeling very sleepy during the day. problems concentrating and making decisions. loss of appetite or overeating (comfort eating). negative thoughts such as feeling you are not a good enough mother, you are unable to look after your baby or your baby does not love you. feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame. feeling anxious that something bad may happen to your baby. problems bonding with your baby, no sense of enjoyment in being with them. Important. If you think you may be depressed talk to a GP, midwife or health visitor as soon as possible so you can access the support you need. Urgent advice: Contact a GP, or call 111, immediately if:. you have frightening thoughts about hurting your baby (these can be scary, but people with these kinds of thoughts rarely harm their baby). you are thinking about suicide and self-harm. you develop unusual beliefs (delusions) or have hallucinations (seeing and hearing things that are not real, like hearing voices). Immediate action required: Call 999 if:. you think there's a danger of immediate harm to yourself or others. Do not struggle on alone and hope the problem will go away. It can continue for months or years or get worse if nothing is done. Depression is treatable and you can get better with the right help. Fathers and partners can also become depressed after the birth of a baby. You should get help if this is affecting you. Spotting the signs in others. Postnatal depression can develop gradually and be hard to recognise. Some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they're feeling because they worry they'll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy. Signs for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include: frequently crying for no obvious reason. having difficulty bonding with their baby, looking after them only as a duty and not wanting to play with them. withdrawing from contact with other people. speaking negatively all the time and saying that they're hopeless. neglecting themselves, such as not washing or changing their clothes. losing their sense of humour. constantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance. If you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings to you, a friend, their GP or their health visitor. Related conditions. As well as postnatal depression, a number of other mental health conditions can also develop after giving birth (as well as during pregnancy). These include: anxiety disorders – including generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder. obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) – intrusive, unwanted and unpleasant thoughts, images or urges that repeatedly enter a person's mind, causing them anxiety and leading to repetitive behaviours. postpartum psychosis – this is a combination of bipolar-like symptoms (feeling ""high"" or ""on top of the world"" or feeling depressed), delusions and hallucinations. Speak to a GP or health visitor if you or someone you know may have developed a mental health condition."
"Postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis is a serious mental health illness that can affect someone soon after having a baby. It affects around 1 in 1,000 mothers after giving birth. Many people who have given birth will experience mild mood changes after having a baby, known as the ""baby blues"". This is normal and usually only lasts for a few days. But postpartum psychosis is very different from the ""baby blues"". It's a serious mental illness and should be treated as a medical emergency. It's sometimes called puerperal psychosis or postnatal psychosis. Symptoms of postpartum psychosis. Symptoms usually start suddenly within the first 2 weeks after giving birth - often within hours or days of giving birth. More rarely, they can develop several weeks after the baby is born. Symptoms can include: hallucinations – hearing, seeing, smelling or feeling things that are not there. delusions – suspicions, fears, thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true. mania – feeling very ""high"" or overactive, for example, talking and thinking too much or too quickly, restlessness or losing normal inhibitions. a low mood – showing signs of depression, being withdrawn or tearful, lacking energy, having a loss of appetite, anxiety, agitation or trouble sleeping. sometimes a mixture of both a manic mood and a low mood - or rapidly changing moods. feeling very confused. When to get medical help. Postpartum psychosis is a serious mental illness that should be treated as a medical emergency. It can get worse rapidly and the illness can risk the safety of the mother and baby. See a GP immediately if you think you, or someone you know, may have developed symptoms of postpartum psychosis. You should request an urgent assessment on the same day. You can call 111 if you cannot speak to a GP or do not know what to do next. Your midwife or health visitor may also be able to help you access care. Call your crisis team if you already have a care plan because you've been assessed as being at high risk of developing postpartum psychosis. Go to A&E or call 999 if you think you, or someone you know, may be in danger of imminent harm. Be aware that if you have postpartum psychosis, you may not realise you're ill. Your partner, family or friends may spot the signs and have to take action. Treating postpartum psychosis. Treatment usually happens in hospital. Ideally, this would be with your baby in a specialist psychiatric unit called a mother and baby unit (MBU). But you may be admitted to a general psychiatric ward until an MBU is available. Most people with postpartum psychosis make a full recovery as long as they receive the right treatment. Medicine. You may be prescribed 1 or more of the following: antipsychotics – to help with manic and psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations. mood stabilisers (for example, lithium) – to stabilise your mood and prevent symptoms recurring. antidepressants – to help ease symptoms if you have significant symptoms of depression and may be used alongside a mood stabiliser. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes recommended if all other treatment options have failed, or when the situation is thought to be life threatening. Psychological therapy. As you move forward with your recovery, you may benefit from seeing a therapist for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. Other forms of support. It can be hard to come to terms with the experience of postpartum psychosis as you recover. Talking to peers and others with lived experience of the illness may be helpful. Some inpatient units and communities have peer support workers who have experienced the illness, and you can also access support through charities. Action on Postpartum Psychosis offers online chat or in-person meetings to support those affected by postpartum psychosis. Causes. It's not clear what causes postpartum psychosis, but you're more at risk if you: already have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. have a family history of mental illness, particularly postpartum psychosis (even if you have no history of mental illness). developed postpartum psychosis after a previous pregnancy. Reducing the risk of postpartum psychosis. If you're at high risk of developing postpartum psychosis, you should have specialist care during or before pregnancy and be seen by a perinatal psychiatrist. You should have a pre-birth planning meeting at around 32 weeks of pregnancy with everyone involved in your care. This includes your partner, family or friends, mental health professionals, your midwife, obstetrician, health visitor and GP. This is to make sure that everyone is aware of your risk of postpartum psychosis. You should all agree on a plan for your care during pregnancy and after you've given birth. You'll get a written copy of your care plan explaining how you and your family can get help quickly if you become ill, as well as strategies you can use to reduce your risk of becoming ill. In the first few weeks after your baby is born, you should have regular home visits from a midwife, health visitor and mental health nurse. Recovering from postpartum psychosis. The most severe symptoms tend to last 2 to 12 weeks, and it can take 6 to 12 months or more to recover completely from the condition. But with treatment and the right support, most people with postpartum psychosis do make a full recovery. An episode of postpartum psychosis is sometimes followed by a period of depression, anxiety and low confidence. It might take a while for you to come to terms with what happened. Some mothers have difficulty bonding with their baby after an episode of postpartum psychosis, or feel some sadness at missing out on time with their baby. With support from your partner, family, friends and your mental health team, or talking to others with lived experience, you can overcome these feelings. Many people who've had postpartum psychosis go on to have more children. Although there is about a 1 in 2 chance you will have another episode after a future pregnancy, you should be able to get help quickly with the right care and the risks can be reduced with appropriate interventions. Support for postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis can have a big impact on your life, but support is available. It might help to speak to others who've had the same condition, or connect with a charity. You may find the following links useful: Action on Postpartum Psychosis (APP). Action on Postpartum Psychosis (APP) have produced a series of guides with the help of women who have experienced postpartum psychosis . These guides cover topics such as: recovering from postpartum psychosis. supporting partners. planning pregnancy. parenting after postpartum psychosis. pregnancy for women with bipolar disorder.

"Treatment - Postnatal depression. Speak to a GP, midwife or health visitor as soon as possible if you think you might have postnatal depression or depression during pregnancy (antenatal depression). With appropriate treatment and support, most women make a full recovery, although it can take time. The 3 main types of treatment are: self-help – for example, talking to your family and friends about your feelings, making time to do things you enjoy, getting as much sleep as you can at night, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. talking therapy – a GP may be able to recommend a self-help course or refer you for a course of therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). antidepressants – these may be recommended if your depression is more severe or other treatments have not helped; your doctor can prescribe a medicine that's safe to take while breastfeeding. Talk to a GP about the pros and cons of different treatments so you can decide together what's best for you. They may check to see if any physical health problems may be causing or contributing to feelings of depression. For instance, you may be anaemic after giving birth or your thyroid may not be working properly. This can cause or add to any feelings of depression. These types of physical health problems can usually be easily treated. Self-help for postnatal depression. Looking after a baby can be stressful and challenging for anyone, and it can be even tougher if you're dealing with postnatal depression as well. There are a number of things you can try yourself to improve your symptoms and help you cope. These include: talking to your partner, friends and family – try to help them understand how you're feeling and what they can do to support you. not trying to be a ""supermum"" – accept help from others when it's offered and ask your loved ones if they can help look after the baby and do tasks such as housework, cooking and shopping. making time for yourself – try to do activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable, such as going for a walk, listening to music, reading a book or having a warm bath. resting when you can – although it can be difficult when you're looking after a baby, try to sleep whenever you get the chance, follow good sleeping habits and ask your partner to help with the night-time work. exercising regularly to boost your mood. eating regular, healthy meals and not going for long periods without eating. not drinking alcohol or taking drugs, as this can make you feel worse. Ask your health visitor about support services in your area. They may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. It can be reassuring to meet other women who are going through something similar. Find postnatal depression support in your area Talking therapies. Talking therapies are usually the first treatment recommended for women with postnatal depression. Guided self-help. Guided self-help involves working through a book or online course on your own or with some help from a therapist. The course materials focus on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them. The courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks. Cognitive behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour. CBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way. For example, some women have unrealistic expectations about what being a mum is like and feel they should never make mistakes. As part of CBT, you'll be encouraged to see that these thoughts are unhelpful and discuss ways to think more positively. CBT can be carried out either 1-to-1 with a therapist or in a group. Treatment will often last 3 to 4 months. Interpersonal therapy. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you're experiencing. It aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners and how they might relate to your feelings of depression. Treatment also usually lasts 3 to 4 months. Find an NHS talking therapies service Antidepressants. Antidepressants may be recommended if you have moderate or severe depression and you do not want to try psychological treatment or psychological treatment does not help. They may also be used if you have mild postnatal depression and a history of depression. Antidepressants work by balancing mood-altering chemicals in your brain. They can help ease symptoms such as low mood, irritability, lack of concentration and sleeplessness, allowing you to function normally and helping you cope better with your new baby. Antidepressants usually need to be taken for at least 1 to 2 weeks before the benefit starts to be felt, so it's important to keep taking them even if you do not notice an improvement straight away. It can take up to 6 weeks to see the full effect. You'll usually need to take them for around 6 months after you start to feel better. If you stop too early, your depression may come back. If you decide to stop taking your medicine, talk to a GP or your specialist. They can help you stop safely. Antidepressants and breastfeeding. If you're breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines, as not all antidepressants are safe to take while breastfeeding. Your doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants and you should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby. When deciding about antidepressants it is important to consider the risks the untreated mental health problem can pose to yourself and your baby, as well as risks associated with side effects. Side effects. General side effects of antidepressants include: feeling sick. blurred vision. a dry mouth. constipation. dizziness. feeling agitated or shaky. These side effects should pass once your body gets used to the medicine. Severe postnatal depression. If your postnatal depression is very severe and does not respond to treatment, you may be referred to a specialist community perinatal mental health team. Specialist community perinatal mental health teams are available across England. These teams provide care and treatment to women with complex mental health needs during pregnancy and after giving birth. They help support the developing relationship between mothers and babies. Ask a GP or health visitor about these teams and whether a referral would be helpful for you. The team will be able to offer additional treatments, such as: more intensive CBT. other talking treatments, such as psychotherapy. therapies such as baby massage to help you bond better with your baby, if this has become a problem. different medicines. If your depression is severe you may be admitted to hospital or a mental health clinic until you are well enough to return home. Ideally this should be with your baby in a specialised mother and baby mental health unit. Charities and support groups. There are a number of national support groups that you can contact for advice. You can also use them to attend events with other parents affected by postnatal depression. These groups include: Association for Post Natal Illness (APNI) – helpline on 020 7386 0868 (10 am to 2 pm, Monday to Friday) or email info@apni.org. Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support (PANDAS) – helpline on 0808 196 1776 (11 am to 10 pm every day) or email info@pandasfoundation.org.uk. NCT – helpline on 0300 330 0700 (9 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday). Mind, the mental health charity – infoline on 0300 123 3393 (9 am to 6 pm, Monday to Friday) or email info@mind.org.uk. You can also search for local support groups and find details of national telephone or email support lines on the Maternal Mental Health Alliance website ."
"Side effects - Antidepressants. The side effects of antidepressants can cause problems at first, but they generally improve with time. It's important to continue treatment, even if you're affected by side effects, as it will take several weeks before you begin to benefit from treatment. With time, you should find that the benefits of treatment outweigh any problems from side effects. During the first few months of treatment, you'll usually see your doctor or a specialist nurse at least once every 2 to 4 weeks to see how well the medicine is working. For more information about your specific medicine, see the patient information leaflet that comes with it. SSRIs and SNRIs. Common side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious. feeling and being sick. indigestion and stomach aches. diarrhoea or constipation. loss of appetite. dizziness. not sleeping well (insomnia), or feeling very sleepy. headaches. loss of libido (reduced sex drive). difficulties achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation. difficulties obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). These side effects should improve within a few weeks, although some can occasionally persist. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Common side effects of TCAs can include: dry mouth. slight blurring of vision. constipation. problems passing urine. drowsiness. dizziness. weight gain. excessive sweating (especially at night). heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia), such as noticeable palpitations or a fast heartbeat (tachycardia). The side effects should ease after a couple of weeks as your body begins to get used to the medicine. Potential health risks. Serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially serious, set of side effects linked to SSRIs and SNRIs. Serotonin syndrome occurs when the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain become too high. It's usually triggered when you take an SSRI or SNRI in combination with another medicine (or substance) that also raises serotonin levels, such as another antidepressant or St John's wort. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome can include: confusion. agitation. muscle twitching. sweating. shivering. diarrhoea. If you experience these symptoms, you should stop taking the medicine and get immediate advice from your GP or specialist. If this is not possible, call NHS 111. Symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome include: seizures (fits). irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). unconsciousness. If you experience symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome, get emergency medical help immediately by dialling 999 to ask for an ambulance. Hyponatraemia. Elderly people who take antidepressants, particularly those who take SSRIs, may experience a severe fall in sodium (salt) levels, known as hyponatraemia. This may lead to a build-up of fluid inside the cells of the body, which can be potentially dangerous. This can happen because SSRIs can block the effects of a hormone that regulates levels of sodium and fluid in the body. Elderly people are vulnerable because fluid levels become more difficult for the body to regulate as people age. Mild hyponatraemia can cause symptoms similar to depression or side effects of antidepressants, such as: feeling sick. headache. muscle pain. reduced appetite. confusion. More severe hyponatraemia can cause: feeling listless and tired. disorientation. agitation. psychosis. seizures (fits). The most serious cases of hyponatraemia can cause you to stop breathing or enter a coma . If you suspect mild hyponatraemia, you should call your GP for advice and stop taking SSRIs for the time being. If you suspect severe hyponatraemia, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Hyponatraemia can be treated by feeding a sodium solution into the body through an intravenous drip. Diabetes. Long-term use of SSRIs and TCAs has been linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes , although it's not clear if the use of these antidepressants directly causes diabetes to develop. It may be that the weight gain some people using antidepressants experience increases the risk of them developing type 2 diabetes. Suicidal thoughts. In rare cases, some people experience suicidal thoughts and a desire to self-harm when they first take antidepressants. Young people under 25 seem particularly at risk. Contact your GP, or go to A&E immediately, if you have thoughts of killing or harming yourself at any time while taking antidepressants. It may be useful to tell a relative or close friend if you've started taking antidepressants and ask them to read the leaflet that comes with your medicines. You should then ask them to tell you if they think your symptoms are getting worse, or if they're worried about changes in your behaviour."
"Uses - Antidepressants. The main use for antidepressants is treating clinical depression in adults. They're also used for other mental health conditions and treatment of long-term pain. In most cases, adults with moderate to severe depression are given antidepressants as a first form of treatment. They're often prescribed along with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . CBT is a type of therapy that uses a problem-solving approach to help improve thought, mood and behaviour. Antidepressants are not always recommended for treating mild depression because research has found limited effectiveness. However, antidepressants are sometimes prescribed for a few months for mild depression to see if you experience any improvement in your symptoms. If you do not see any benefits in this time, the medicine will be slowly withdrawn. Initially, a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is usually prescribed. If your symptoms have not improved after about 4 weeks, an alternative antidepressant may be recommended or your dose may be increased. Many antidepressants can be prescribed by your GP, but some types can only be used under the supervision of a mental health professional. If the depression does not respond to antidepressants alone, other treatments such as CBT may also be used to help achieve better results. They may also give higher doses of the medicine. Children and young people. Children and young people with moderate to severe depression should first be offered a course of psychotherapy (talking therapy) that lasts for at least 3 months. In some cases, an SSRI called fluoxetine may be offered in combination with psychotherapy to treat moderate to severe depression in young people aged 12 to 18. Other mental health conditions. Antidepressants can also be used to help treat other mental health conditions, including: anxiety disorder. obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). panic disorder. serious phobias, such as agoraphobia and social anxiety (social phobia). bulimia. post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As with depression, SSRIs are usually the first choice of treatment for these conditions. If SSRIs prove ineffective, another type of antidepressant can be used. Long-term pain. Even though a type of antidepressant called tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were not originally designed to be painkillers, there's evidence to suggest they're effective in treating long-term (chronic) nerve pain in some people. Chronic nerve pain, also known as neuropathic pain, is caused by nerve damage or other problems with the nerves, and is often unresponsive to regular painkillers, such as paracetamol . Amitriptyline is a TCA that's usually used to treat neuropathic pain. Conditions that may benefit from treatment with amitriptyline include: complex regional pain syndrome. peripheral neuropathy. multiple sclerosis (MS). conditions where a nerve becomes trapped, such as sciatica. Antidepressants have also been used to treat cases of chronic pain that do not involve nerves (non-neuropathic pain). However, they're thought to be less effective for this purpose. As well as TCAs, SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can also be used to treat chronic non-neuropathic pain. Conditions that cause non-neuropathic pain which may benefit from treatment with antidepressants include fibromyalgia , chronic back pain and chronic neck pain . Bedwetting in children. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are sometimes used to treat bedwetting in children , if other treatments have not worked. They can help relax the muscles of the bladder. This increases bladder capacity and reduces the urge to urinate."
"Treatment - Depression in adults. Treatment for depression usually involves a combination of self-help, talking therapies and medicines. The treatment recommended will be based on the type of depression you have. Mild depression. If you have less severe (mild) depression, the following treatments may be recommended. Wait and see. If a GP diagnoses you with mild depression, they may suggest waiting a short time to see if it gets better by itself. In this case, you'll be seen again by the GP after 2 to 4 weeks to monitor your progress. This is known as watchful waiting. Guided self-help. Your GP may suggest trying guided self-help to see if it can help with your depression. You'll usually have 6 to 8 sessions where you work through a workbook or online course, with support from a therapist. The sessions may be in person, by phone or online. Guided self-help for depression is usually based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . CBT is a type of therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. Exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help depression, and it's one of the main treatments for mild depression. You may be referred to a group exercise class that's designed to help with depression. Find out more about walking for health and exercise for depression . Talking therapies. If you have mild depression that's not improving, you may find a talking therapy helpful. There are different types of talking therapies for depression, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling. A GP can refer you for talking therapies, or you can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Find an NHS talking therapies service Moderate to severe depression. If you have more severe depression, which includes moderate or severe depression, the following treatments may be recommended. Antidepressants. Antidepressants are medicines that treat the symptoms of depression . There are many different types of antidepressant. They have to be prescribed by a doctor, usually for depression that's moderate or severe. Combination therapy. A GP may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy, particularly if your depression is quite severe. A combination of an antidepressant and CBT usually works better than having just one of these treatments. Mental health teams. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Behavioural activation. Behavioural activation therapy focuses on identifying links between your activities and your mood, rather than focusing on thoughts and feelings. It can be useful if depression has led to you withdrawing from social activities. It helps you to make practical changes to your behaviour that may improve your mood. If it's recommended you'll usually have 12 to 16 individual sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Individual problem-solving. Individual problem-solving is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying problems and developing plans to solve them. It's only recommended for more severe depression. If it's recommended you'll usually have 6 to 12 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Psychodynamic psychotherapy. In psychodynamic (psychoanalytic) psychotherapy, a psychoanalytic therapist will encourage you to say whatever is going through your mind. This will help you become aware of difficult feelings in significant relationships and stressful situations, and how patterns in what you do or say may be contributing to your problems. If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Counselling. Counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you're experiencing in your life so you can find new ways of dealing with them. Counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems, but do not tell you what to do. You can talk in confidence to a counsellor, who supports you and offers practical advice. On the NHS, you may be offered 8 to 16 sessions of counselling, depending on how severe your condition is. It's ideal for people who are generally healthy but need help coping with a current crisis, such as anger , relationship issues, bereavement , redundancy, infertility or a serious illness. Behavioural couples therapy. You may be offered behavioural couples therapy if relationship problems could be contributing to your depression, or if involving your partner could help with your treatment. If it's recommended you'll usually have 15 to 20 sessions over 5 to 6 months. Getting help. See a GP for more information about accessing NHS talking therapies . They can refer you for local talking therapies for depression. You also have the option of self-referral. This means that if you prefer not to talk to a GP, you can go directly to an NHS talking therapies service . Waiting times for talking therapies can be several weeks or months. A GP can tell you how long you might need to wait, and what to do if your condition gets worse or you need support during this time. Antidepressants. Antidepressants are medicines that treat the symptoms of depression . There are many different types available. Most people with moderate or severe depression benefit from antidepressants, but not everybody does. You may respond to 1 antidepressant but not to another, and you may need to try 2 or more treatments before you find one that works for you. The different types of antidepressant work about as well as each other. But side effects vary between different treatments and people. When you start taking antidepressants, you should see a GP or specialist nurse every week or 2 for at least 4 weeks to assess how well they're working. Contact a GP straight away if you have any feelings of hopelessness or suicidal thoughts that start or get worse after starting antidepressants. You should find that your symptoms start to improve within 4 weeks of starting antidepressants. If they're working, you'll need to continue taking them at the same dose for at least 4 to 6 months after your symptoms have eased. If you have had episodes of depression in the past, you may need to continue to take antidepressants long term. You'll be reviewed at least twice a year to see whether you need to keep taking them. Antidepressants are not addictive, but you may get some withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or you miss a dose. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). If a GP thinks you'd benefit from taking an antidepressant, you'll usually be prescribed a modern type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are sertraline (Lustral) , paroxetine (Seroxat) , fluoxetine (Prozac) and citalopram (Cipramil) . They help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a ""good mood"" chemical. SSRIs work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects, although they can cause nausea, headaches , a dry mouth , tiredness, sleeping problems and problems having sex. But these side effects usually improve over time. SSRIs may not be prescribed for people with certain health conditions, or for children and young people under 18 years of age. Research shows that the risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour may increase if they're taken by under-18 s. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can be prescribed for under-18 s and, even then, only when a specialist has given the go-ahead. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a group of antidepressants used to treat moderate to severe depression. TCAs, including imipramine (Imipramil) and amitriptyline , have been around for longer than SSRIs. They work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood. Side effects of TCAs vary from person to person but may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, feeling lightheaded and excessive drowsiness. Some of the side effects may gradually improve as your body gets used to the medicine. Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Antidepressants such as venlafaxine (Efexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta or Yentreve) work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs. They're known as serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Like TCAs, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. Studies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, but they can lead to a rise in blood pressure. Mirtazapine. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that increases the amount of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. It's sometimes used together with other types of antidepressant. It can make you feel sleepy. This can be helpful if you have depression and difficulties getting to sleep. Vortioxetine. Vortioxetine (Brintellix or Lundbeck) is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for treating adults who are having a first or recurrent major depressive episode, if the current episode has not responded to 2 other antidepressants. Common side effects associated with vortioxetine include abnormal dreams, constipation , diarrhoea , dizziness, itching , nausea and vomiting. Withdrawal symptoms. Antidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but you may have some withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking them. You'll be advised to reduce your dose gradually to help avoid withdrawal symptoms. These can include: an upset stomach. flu-like symptoms. anxiety. dizziness. vivid dreams at night. sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks. In most cases, these are quite mild and last no longer than 1 or 2 weeks, but occasionally they can be quite severe. They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor). Contact a doctor if you get withdrawal symptoms and they do not improve after 1 or 2 weeks or they get worse.  Other treatments. Mindfulness. Mindfulness involves paying closer attention to the present moment, and focusing on your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and the world around you to improve your mental wellbeing. The aim is to develop a better understanding of your mind and body, and learn how to live with more appreciation and less anxiety. Group mindfulness is recommended by NICE as an option for treating less severe depression. St John's wort. St John's wort is a herbal treatment that some people take for depression. It's available from health food shops and pharmacies. There's some evidence that it may help less severe depression, but it's not recommended by doctors. This is because the amount of active ingredients varies among individual brands and batches, so you can never be sure what sort of effect it'll have on you. Taking St John's wort with other medicines, such as anticonvulsants, anticoagulants , antidepressants and the contraceptive pill , can also cause serious problems. You should not take St John's wort if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, as we do not know for sure that it's safe. Also, St John's wort can interact with the contraceptive pill, reducing its effectiveness. Brain stimulation. Brain stimulation is sometimes recommended by a specialist to treat severe depression that has not responded to other treatments. Electromagnetic currents can be used to stimulate certain areas of the brain to try to improve the symptoms of depression . There are a number of different types of brain stimulation that can be used to treat depression. These include: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Lithium. If you have tried several different antidepressants and there's been no improvement, a specialist may offer you a medicine called lithium in addition to your current treatment. There are 2 types: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you're taking one that works for you, it's best not to change. If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. You'll therefore need blood tests every 3 to 6 months to check your lithium levels and check for side effects while you're on the medicine. You'll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic."
"Stopping or coming off antidepressants. Talk to your doctor before you stop taking antidepressants . It's important that you do not stop taking antidepressants suddenly. A dose of antidepressants should be slowly reduced, normally over several weeks, and sometimes longer. This varies depending on the type of antidepressant you're taking, your dose and how long you've been taking it for. Your doctor will help you agree a plan for how to gradually reduce your dose. This is to prevent any withdrawal symptoms you might get as a reaction to coming off antidepressants suddenly. Withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms may include: restlessness. trouble sleeping. unsteadiness. sweating. stomach problems. feeling as if there's an electric shock in your head. changes to your mood, such as low mood or feeling irritable, anxious or confused. Withdrawal symptoms usually come on within 5 days of stopping the medicine and generally last 1 to 2 weeks. Some people have severe withdrawal symptoms that last for several months or more. See your doctor if you get severe withdrawal symptoms after you stop taking antidepressants. Alternative approaches can be used, such as reintroducing another antidepressant from the same group and reducing the dose more slowly, or stopping completely and managing your symptoms.

"Psychiatry. Psychiatry is a medical field concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental health conditions. A doctor who works in psychiatry is called a psychiatrist. Unlike other mental health professionals, such as psychologists and counsellors, psychiatrists must be medically qualified doctors who have chosen to specialise in psychiatry. This means they can prescribe medication as well as recommend other forms of treatment. Most psychiatrists work as part of community mental health teams (CMHTs), in outpatient clinics or hospital wards. Some carry out sessions in GP surgeries. What conditions can psychiatrists treat? Mental health conditions that may be diagnosed and treated by a psychiatrist include: anxiety and panic attacks. phobias. obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). personality disorders. schizophrenia. depression and bipolar disorder. dementia and Alzheimer's disease. eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. sleep disorders, such as insomnia. addictions, such as drug or alcohol misuse. Psychiatrists may also provide psychological support for people with long-term, painful or terminal physical health conditions. Getting an appointment with a psychiatrist. You'll usually need a referral from your GP or another doctor to see a psychiatrist on the NHS. Your GP may refer you directly to a psychiatrist or to a member of a local mental health team, who can assess your needs and help determine if you need to see a psychiatrist or a different mental health professional. If you are under 18, you may be referred to your local children and young people's mental health services. You can also see a psychiatrist privately, although most private psychiatrists prefer a referral from your GP. Your GP may be able to recommend psychiatrists in your area. You can also try contacting a psychiatric clinic directly or using online psychiatry services. You'll see a psychiatrist who specialises in the area of psychiatry most relevant to your situation. The main areas of expertise include: childhood and adolescent psychiatry. general adult psychiatry. older person's psychiatry. learning disabilities. psychotherapy (talking therapies). You can check the details of a psychiatrist, including their area of speciality, by looking on the medical register , a list of doctors in the UK. If they have the letters MRCPsych (Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) or FRCPsych (Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) after their name, they're a current member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) . What happens during your appointments. During your first appointment, your psychiatrist will carry out an initial assessment. They'll look at both your mental and physical health, and may ask: about the problem that brought you to see them. general questions about your life and thoughts. to carry out a simple physical examination, such as checking your blood pressure – for example, before prescribing certain medications. for information from other sources, such as your GP, relatives and social workers. After assessing your condition, your psychiatrist may prescribe medication or recommend other treatments, such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . The number of times you need to see a psychiatrist and the length of each appointment will depend on your circumstances. A psychiatrist may continue to manage your treatment or they may refer you to other community mental health services in your area. These services work in small units or clinics and aim to help people manage their illness so they can lead a normal life within the community. Further information and support. The Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) has mental health information in a number of areas, including problems and disorders, support and treatment, and advice for parents or carers and young people."

Draw a table with 2 columns. Write your health worries in the 1 st column, then more balanced thoughts in the 2 nd. For example, in the 1 st column you may write, ""I'm worried about these headaches"" and in the 2 nd, ""Headaches can often be a sign of stress"". Keep busy with other things. When you get the urge to check your body, for example, distract yourself by going for a walk or calling a friend. Get back to normal activities.

"Anxiety in children. Just like adults, children and young people feel worried and anxious at times. But if your child's anxiety is starting to affect their wellbeing, they may need some help. What makes children anxious? Children can feel anxious about different things at different ages. Many of these worries are a normal part of growing up. From the age of around 6 months to 3 years it's very common for young children to have separation anxiety . They may become clingy and cry when separated from their parents or carers. This is a normal stage in a child's development and should stop at around age 2 to 3. It's also common for preschool-age children to develop specific fears or phobias. Common fears in early childhood include animals, insects, storms, heights, water, blood and the dark. These fears usually go away gradually on their own. There may also be other times in a child's life when they feel anxious. For example, many children feel anxious when going to a new school or before tests and exams. Some children feel shy in social situations and may need support with this. Starting secondary school can also be difficult. The school is bigger, your child has to make new friends and is responsible for managing their day. When is anxiety a problem for children? Anxiety becomes a problem for children when it starts to get in the way of their everyday life. If you go into any school at exam time, all the children will be anxious, but some may be so anxious that they do not manage to get to school that morning. Anxiety can start to cause problems for your child when: it’s very strong, or getting worse, and does not go away. it gets in the way of daily activities, stopping your child doing things they enjoy. Severe anxiety like this can harm children's mental and emotional wellbeing, affecting their self-esteem and confidence. They may become withdrawn and go to great lengths to avoid things or situations that make them feel anxious. What are the signs of anxiety in children? When young children feel anxious, they cannot always understand or express what they are feeling. You may notice that they: become irritable, tearful or clingy. have difficulty sleeping. wake in the night. start wetting the bed. have bad dreams. often have stomach aches or headaches. In older children you may notice that they: lack confidence to try new things or seem unable to face simple, everyday challenges. find it hard to concentrate. have problems with sleeping or eating. have angry outbursts. have a lot of negative thoughts, or keep thinking that bad things are going to happen. start avoiding everyday activities, such as seeing friends, going out in public or going to school. Find out more about the symptoms of anxiety on our page about anxiety disorders in children . Why is my child anxious? Some children are more likely to have worries and anxiety than others. They often find change difficult and may become anxious following a house move or when starting a new school. Children who have had a distressing or traumatic experience, such as a car accident or house fire, may have anxiety afterwards. Family arguments and conflict can also make children feel insecure and anxious. At school, children may feel anxious about things like school work, their teachers, bullying or being lonely. They might struggle with things like the noise of other children in the school. Teenagers are more likely to have social anxiety than other age groups, avoiding social gatherings or making excuses to get out of them. Find out more about social anxiety . How to help an anxious child. If a child is experiencing anxiety, there are things that parents and carers can do to help. First and foremost, it's important to talk to your child about their anxiety or worries. Listen to them carefully to understand their feelings. Try not to make assumptions or dismiss their worries. Reassure them that recognizing and talking about problems is good, and show them you understand how they feel. If your child is old enough, it may help to explain what anxiety is and the physical effects it has on our bodies. Describe anxiety as a natural reaction to stress that affects our thoughts, feelings and behaviour. It may be helpful to describe anxiety as being like a wave that builds up and then goes away again. As well as talking to your child about their worries and anxiety, it's important to help them find solutions to their worries. For example, if your child is worried about going to a sleepover, talk to them and get them to make a plan involving a close friend or another parent being there. This can help with problem-solving and confidence. If your child is worried about school, you can work with them and the school to identify the problem and find solutions together. This might include getting support from a peer mentor, or avoiding a noisy playground by coming in early to help tidy the classroom. Most schools offer quiet or safe spaces for anxious pupils. It can help to: talk with your child to find out what makes them feel anxious. It could be certain times or situations. think of ways to find solutions to make things better at home and school. set up a meeting with your child's teacher or SENCO (special education needs co-ordinator). It’s important to acknowledge their anxiety and find helpful ways of dealing with it. Do not force your child into a stressful situation without talking to them about what’s making them anxious first. This could make the problem worse. If your child is really struggling and it's affecting their everyday life, it might be good to talk to your GP or school nurse. Other ways to ease anxiety in children. teach your child to recognise signs of anxiety in themselves. encourage your child to manage their anxiety and ask for help when they need it. children of all ages find routines reassuring, so try to stick to regular daily routines where possible. if your child is anxious because of distressing events, such as a bereavement or separation, look for books or films that will help them to understand their feelings and realise it’s normal to feel sad or anxious in these situations. if you know a change, such as a house move, is coming up, prepare your child by talking to them about what is going to happen and why. prepare your child for change before they move from primary to secondary school and then give them extra support when they begin secondary. try not to become overprotective or anxious yourself. practise simple relaxation techniques with your child, such as taking 3 deep, slow breaths, breathing in for a count of 3 and out for 3. distraction can be helpful for young children. For example, if they are anxious about going to nursery, play games on the way there, such as seeing who can spot the most red cars. turn an empty tissue box into a ""worry"" box. Get your child to write about or draw their worries and ""post"" them into the box. Then you can sort through the box together at the end of the day or week. Find out more.

"Teen aggression and arguments. Find out how to cope with heated arguments with your teenager, and what to do if they become violent. This page covers: How to defuse arguments with your teen. How to deal with violent behaviour. Concerned about mental health issues? Help and support. How to defuse arguments with your teen. It's useful to remember that your own behaviour can improve or worsen an aggressive situation, so it's important to be a good role model for your teen. If you act aggressively but tell your teenager not to, they will not listen. It's also helpful to remember that their anger is often based on fear that they're losing control. Try these tips: try to maintain a calm and peaceful presence – you need to be strong without being threatening. make sure your body language reflects your willingness to listen. give them personal space. if an argument feels out of control, explain to your teen that you are going to walk away and come back again in half an hour in order for things to calm down. Breathing exercises can help take the intensity out of an argument. Take a deep breath, hold for a few seconds and then exhale. Repeat 5 times. When your teen is calm, suggest this technique to them so they, too, have a way of controlling their anger. Remember that teens may not know how to handle their anger, and this can leave them frustrated and frightened. However, as with toddlers, if you give in to teenagers because their shouting and screaming intimidates or baffles you, you are in effect encouraging them to repeat the unreasonable behaviour as a way of getting what they want. How to deal with violent behaviour. Sometimes, teen aggression can turn into violence. If they lash out at you, or someone or something else, put safety first. Let your teenager know that violence is unacceptable and you will walk away from them until they've calmed down. If leaving the room or house is not helping, call the police. After all, if you feel threatened or scared, then you have the right to protect yourself. Family Lives offers this advice for coping with, and helping, a violent teen: give them space – once they have calmed down, you may want to talk to them about what has happened and suggest that they let you find them some help. be clear – teenagers need to know that you will stand by the boundaries you set. They need to know that any kind of violence is unacceptable. talk to their school – find out if their aggressive behaviour is happening there as well. Some schools offer counselling. avoid using violence towards your teen – this sets a positive example that violence is not OK. arrange counselling – if your teen admits they have a problem and is willing to get help, book an appointment with a counsellor or psychologist as soon as possible. Speak to a GP or their school about what help is available. Concerned about mental health issues? If you're worried that your teen has a mental health problem such as depression , talk to a GP. They can refer them to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, who in turn can refer you and your family for Family Therapy.

"Coping with your teenager. Many parents find their teenager's behaviour challenging. Teenagers' behaviour can be baffling, stressful, hurtful and often worrying. But in most cases it does not mean there is anything more serious going on than the natural process of becoming an adult. Many of the common behaviour issues that parents find hard are an essential part of puberty and growing up. Surges of hormones, combined with body changes, struggling to find an identity, pressures from friends and a developing sense of independence, mean the teenage years are a confusing time for your child. It can mean they, for example: become aloof. want more time alone or with friends. feel misunderstood. reject your attempts to talk or show affection. appear sullen and moody.  Your feelings about your teen's behaviour. Teenagers can challenge even the calmest of parents. When you have further pressures in your life, such as other children, work, relationships, family commitments or illness, it can feel as though your teenager is going to push you over the edge. Try to step back from the situation, and remember your child or young person may have physiological reasons for behaving in ways that can be difficult to live with. They're probably not enjoying it either. You're the adult and you will feel that it's your responsibility to guide them through the difficult times, but that is not always easy. Do not expect to enjoy your time with them all of the time, and remember to look after yourself. How do I cope with the stress? Parenting a teenager can be exhausting, so it's important to look after yourself, too. Family Lives , a charity dedicated to helping families, offers the following advice: make sure you set aside time for yourself. give yourself permission to relax or even treat yourself occasionally. talk about your concerns to your partner or friends, or join a support group or forum. learn techniques for coping with low mood, sadness and depression or anxiety. If you're concerned that you're depressed, anxious or stressed, talk to a GP. How should I act with my teenager? Teenagers can be largely emotional rather than logical because of their hormones. It is not necessarily pleasant for them, and it can even feel frightening. Although it might be hard for you, they need you to maintain a calm consistent presence. Follow these tips: decide what the boundaries are and stick to them – teenagers may object to these but know they're a sign that you care about them. listen to them when they do want to talk and try not to interrupt until they've finished speaking. allow them to learn from their own mistakes – as long as they are safe – and accept they might do things differently to you. do not bottle up your concerns – if you're worried your teenager may be having unprotected sex or using drugs, try talking calmly and direct them to useful information. allow them to have their own space and privacy. The Young Minds website has more information about parenting that covers many of these subjects. Where can I find more information and support?

"Worried about your teenager? It can be difficult for parents to tell whether their teenagers are just ""being teens"" or if there is something more serious going on. Many of the things you may notice, such as changing moods, can often be attributed to normal teenage behaviour. However, it can be helpful to know when there may be signs of a more serious problem. If you're worried about your teenager's behaviour or general wellbeing you should consider: speaking to your teenager about your worries. getting advice from a GP. It's important to know that many parents and carers find teenage behaviour difficult to understand or challenging to cope with.  Depression in teenagers. Noticeable symptoms of depression in teenagers can include: continuous low mood or sadness as well as frequent tearfulness. voicing or showing feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. being irritable and intolerant of others. little or no enjoyment of things that were once interesting to them. increasing social isolation. disturbed sleep patterns (for example, problems going to sleep and/or waking throughout the night).  The most common eating disorders include anorexia , bulimia , binge eating and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OFSED). OFSED, when symptoms do not exactly match those of anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder, can be just as serious. Some children and young people may experience avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Signs of eating disorders can include: complaining about being fat, even though they are a normal weight or are underweight. letting people around them think they have eaten when they have not. being secretive about their eating habits. becoming anxious, upset or guilty when asked to eat. vomiting, or using laxatives in order to lose weight.  Teenagers who self-harm. If you suspect that your teenager is self-harming, look out for any of the following signs: unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on their wrists, arms, thighs and chest. keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather. signs of depression, such as low mood, tearfulness, a lack of interest in everything. signs of low self-esteem, such as blaming themselves for any problems or thinking they are not good enough. signs they have been pulling out their hair.  Teenagers who take drugs. Signs that your teenager is taking drugs can include: losing interest in hobbies, sports or other favourite activities. dramatic changes in behaviour. excessive tiredness and lack of appetite. dilated pupils, red eyes, bad skin. stealing money from you. Find out more about drug addiction and getting help . How can I help my teenager? If you're worried about your teenager and they refuse to talk to you, you may need to open up other channels of communication. Avoid persistent direct questioning as this can make them feel threatened. Try these tips to encourage your teenager to open up if there is a problem: be honest and explain that you're worried that they're going through something difficult. point them towards websites or helplines that can give them information on depression, drugs and self-harm so they can find out the facts themselves. do not blame yourself for any problems they're having and try not to take it personally – this will not help the situation. tell them you'll be there for them when they do want to talk. let them choose where to go for help, which may be a GP, a family friend or school counsellor. help your teenager think for themselves – encourage them to think through the pros and cons of their behaviour, remind them what they're good at and what you like about them, and help them think critically about what they see and hear.

"Help your child beat exam stress. Tests and exams can be a challenging part of school life for children and young people and their parents or carers. But there are ways to ease the stress. Watch for signs of stress. Children and young people who are stressed may: worry a lot. feel tense. have headaches and stomach pains. not sleep well. be irritable. lose interest in food or eat more than normal. not enjoy activities they previously enjoyed. be negative and have a low mood. feel hopeless about the future. Having someone to talk to about their work can help. Support from a parent, tutor or study buddy can help young people share their worries and keep things in perspective. Encourage your child to talk to a member of school staff who they feel is supportive. If you think your child is not coping, it may also be helpful for you to talk to their teachers. Try to involve your child as much as possible. Make sure your child eats well. A balanced diet is vital for your child's health, and can help them feel well during exam periods. Some parents find high-fat, high-sugar and high-caffeine foods and drinks, such as energy drinks, cola, sweets, chocolate, burgers and chips, make their children hyperactive, irritable and moody. Where possible, involve your child in shopping for food and encourage them to choose some healthy snacks.  Help your child get enough sleep. Good sleep improves thinking and concentration. Most teenagers need 8 to 10 hours' sleep a night. Allow half an hour or so for your child to wind down between studying, watching TV or using a computer and going to bed, to help them get a good night's sleep. Cramming all night before an exam is usually a bad idea. Sleep will benefit your child far more than a few hours of panicky last-minute study. Be flexible during exams. Be flexible around exam time. When your child is revising all day, do not worry about household jobs left undone or untidy bedrooms. Staying calm yourself can help. Remember, exams do not last forever. Help them study. Make sure your child has somewhere comfortable to study. Ask them how you can support them with their revision. Help them come up with practical ideas that will help them revise, such as drawing up a revision schedule or getting hold of past papers for practice. To motivate your child, encourage them to think about their goals in life and see how their revision and exams are related to them. Talk about exam nerves. Remind your child that it's normal to feel anxious. Nervousness is a natural reaction to exams. The key is to put these nerves to positive use. If anxiety is getting in the way rather than helping, encourage your child to practise the activities they'll be doing on the day of the exam. This will help it feel less scary. For example, this may involve doing practice papers under exam conditions or seeing the exam hall beforehand. School staff should be able to help with this. Help your child face their fears and see these activities through, rather than avoiding them. Encourage them to think about what they know and the time they've already put into studying to help them feel more confident. Encourage exercise during exams. Exercise can help boost energy levels, clear the mind and relieve stress. It does not matter what it is – walking, cycling, swimming, football and dancing are all effective. Activities that involve other people can be particularly helpful.  Do not add to the pressure. Support group Childline says many children who contact them feel that most pressure at exam time comes from their family. Listen to your child, give them support and avoid criticism. Before they go in for a test or exam, be reassuring and positive. Let them know that failing is not the end of the world. If things do not go well they may be able to take the exam again. After each exam, encourage your child to talk it through with you. Discuss the parts that went well rather than focusing on the questions they found difficult. Then move on and focus on the next test, rather than dwelling on things that cannot be changed. Make time for treats. With your child, think about rewards for doing revision and getting through each exam. Rewards do not need to be big or expensive. They can include simple things like making their favourite meal or watching TV. When the exams are over, help your child celebrate by organising an end-of-exams treat. When to get help. Some young people feel much better when exams are over, but that's not the case for all young people. Get help if your child's anxiety or low mood is severe, persists and interferes with their everyday life. Seeing a GP is a good place to start. "
"Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness ""mindfulness"". Mindfulness can help us enjoy life more and understand ourselves better. You can take steps to develop it in your own life. What is mindfulness? Mindfulness involves paying attention to what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment. It's easy to stop noticing the world around us. It's also easy to lose touch with the way our bodies are feeling and to end up living ""in our heads"" – caught up in our thoughts without stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour. An important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our bodies and the sensations they experience. This means paying attention to the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the present moment. That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs. Another important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they happen moment to moment. How mindfulness helps mental wellbeing. Becoming more aware of the present moment can help us enjoy the world around us more and understand ourselves better. When we become more aware of the present moment, we begin to experience afresh things that we have been taking for granted. Mindfulness also allows us to become more aware of the stream of thoughts and feelings that we experience, and to see how we can become entangled in that stream in ways that are not helpful. This lets us stand back from our thoughts and start to see their patterns. Gradually, we can train ourselves to notice when our thoughts are taking over and realise that thoughts are simply ""mental events"" that do not have to control us. Mindfulness can help us deal with issues more productively. We can ask: ""Is trying to solve this by brooding about it helpful, or am I just getting caught up in my thoughts?"" Awareness of this kind may also help us notice signs of stress or anxiety earlier and deal with them better. Mindfulness-based therapies are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a way to treat less severe depression . NICE also recommends that employers make mindfulness available to all employees, to support mental wellbeing at work. How to be more mindful. Reminding yourself to take notice of your thoughts, feelings, body sensations and the world around you is the first step to mindfulness. Notice the everyday. As we go about our daily lives, we can notice the sensations of things, the food we eat, the air moving past the body as we walk. Keep it regular. It can be helpful to pick a regular time, such as a morning journey to work or a walk at lunchtime, during which you decide to be aware of the sensations created by the world around you. Try something new. Trying new things, such as sitting in a different seat in meetings or going somewhere new for lunch, can also help you notice the world in a new way. Watch your thoughts. Some people find it very difficult to practise mindfulness. As soon as they stop what they're doing, lots of thoughts and worries crowd in. It might be useful to remember that mindfulness isn't about making these thoughts go away, but rather about seeing them as mental events that come and go. This can be very hard at first, but with gentle persistence it is possible. Some people find that it is easier to cope with an over-busy mind if they are doing gentle yoga or walking. Name thoughts and feelings. To develop an awareness of thoughts and feelings, some people find it helpful to silently name them: ""Here's the thought that I might fail that exam"" or: ""This is anxiety"". Free yourself from the past and future. You can practise mindfulness anywhere, but it can be especially helpful to take a mindful approach if you realise that, for several minutes, you have been trapped in reliving past problems or pre-living future worries. Different mindfulness practices. As well as practising mindfulness in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more formal mindfulness practice. Mindfulness meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind starts to wander. Yoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing. Information: Learn how to meditate with this beginner’s guide to meditation from Every Mind Matters . Is mindfulness helpful for everyone? Studies show that mindfulness can help with stress, anxiety and depression. More research is needed to show whether it helps with other mental health conditions. Many people find mindfulness helpful, but it's not right for everyone. Some people find that it does not help them, or that it can make them feel worse. More tips for wellbeing.

"Causes - Depression in adults. There's no single cause of depression. It can occur for a variety of reasons and it has many different triggers. For some people, an upsetting or stressful life event, such as bereavement , divorce, illness, redundancy and job or money worries, can be the cause. Different causes can often combine to trigger depression. For example, you may feel low after being ill and then experience a traumatic event, such as a bereavement, which brings on depression. People often talk about a ""downward spiral"" of events that leads to depression. For example, if your relationship with your partner breaks down, you're likely to feel low, you may stop seeing friends and family and you may start drinking more. All of this can make you feel worse and trigger depression. Some studies have also suggested that you're more likely to get depression as you get older, and that it's more common in people who live in difficult social and economic circumstances. It's thought that your chance of getting severe depression may be partly affected by the genes you inherit from your parents. Stressful events. Most people take time to come to terms with stressful events, such as bereavement or a relationship breakdown. When these stressful events occur, your risk of becoming depressed is increased if you stop seeing your friends and family and try to deal with your problems on your own. Personality. You may be more vulnerable to depression if you have certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem or being overly self-critical. This may be because of the genes you've inherited from your parents, your early life experiences, or both. Family history. If someone in your family has had depression in the past, such as a parent, sister or brother, it's more likely that you'll also develop it. It's thought that severe depression in particular may be partly caused by the genes you inherit from your parents. But depression is usually caused by a combination of triggers such as life events, so having a family history of depression does not always mean that you'll develop it. Pregnancy and giving birth. Some women are particularly vulnerable to depression after pregnancy. The hormonal and physical changes, as well as the added responsibility of a new life, can lead to postnatal depression . Sometimes depression starts before you give birth. Depression in pregnancy is known as antenatal depression. Menopause. Menopause is when your periods stop due to lower hormone levels. Sometimes menopause can trigger depression, particularly in the first few years. Menopause can also cause symptoms such as sadness and mood swings. Mental health symptoms caused by menopause are different from depression. Loneliness. Feeling lonely , caused by things such as becoming cut off from your family and friends, can increase your risk of depression. Alcohol and drugs. When life is getting them down, some people try to cope by drinking too much alcohol or taking drugs . This can result in a spiral of depression. Cannabis can help you relax, but there's evidence that it can also bring on depression, particularly in teenagers. ""Drowning your sorrows"" with a drink is also not recommended. Alcohol affects the chemistry of the brain, which increases the risk of depression. Illness. You may have a higher risk of depression if you have a longstanding or life-threatening illness, such as coronary heart disease , cancer or a condition that causes long-term pain. Head injuries are also an often under-recognised cause of depression. A severe head injury can trigger mood swings and emotional problems. In some people an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can cause depression."
"Diagnosis - Depression in adults. If you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day, every day for more than 2 weeks, you should seek help from a GP. It's particularly important to speak to a GP if you: have symptoms of depression that are not improving. find your mood affects your work, other interests, and relationships with your family and friends. have thoughts of suicide or self-harm. Sometimes, when you're depressed it can be difficult to imagine that treatment can actually help. But the sooner you seek treatment, the sooner your depression will improve. There are no physical tests for depression, but a GP may examine you and carry out some urine or blood tests to rule out other conditions that have similar symptoms, such as an underactive thyroid . The main way a GP will tell if you have depression is by asking you questions about your general health and how the way you're feeling is affecting your daily life, both mentally and physically. They'll also ask about your medical history, any previous mental health problems, your home environment and lifestyle, and any recent triggers such as stressful events. They'll ask about whether you've had thoughts of suicide or self-harm. A GP may use a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. Try to be as open and honest as you can be with your answers. Describing your symptoms and how they're affecting you will help the GP determine whether you have depression and how severe it is. Any discussion you have with a GP will be confidential. This rule will only ever be broken if there's a significant risk of harm to either yourself or others, and if informing a family member or carer would reduce that risk."
"Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness ""mindfulness"", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you support and an insight into your own depression. You may not feel comfortable about discussing your mental health and sharing your distress with others. If this is the case, writing about how you feel or expressing your emotions through poetry or art are other ways to help your mood. Here's a list of depression support groups and information about how to access them. Smoking, drugs and alcohol. If you have depression it may be tempting to smoke or drink to make you feel better. Cigarettes and alcohol may seem to help at first, but they make things worse in the long run. Be extra cautious with cannabis. You might think it's harmless, but research has shown a strong link between cannabis use and mental illness, including depression. A GP can give you advice and support if you drink or smoke too much or use drugs. You may also find the following pages useful: quit smoking. drug addiction: getting help. alcohol support. Work and finances. If your depression is caused by working too much or if it's affecting your ability to do your job, you may need time off to recover. It's important to avoid too much stress, and this includes work-related stress. If you're employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or work in a more flexible way, particularly if job pressures seem to trigger your symptoms. Under the Equality Act 2010, all employers must make reasonable adjustments to make the employment of people with disabilities possible. This can include people who've been diagnosed with a mental illness. Find out more about the Equality Act 2010 on the GOV.UK website . If you're unable to work as a result of your depression, you may be eligible for a range of benefits, depending on your circumstances. You can find out more about these benefits from GOV.UK: GOV.UK: Statutory Sick Pay. GOV.UK: Incapacity Benefit. GOV.UK: Personal Independence Payment. GOV.UK: Attendance Allowance. GOV.UK: Carer's Allowance. GOV.UK: Council Tax Reduction. GOV.UK: Housing Benefit. Looking after someone with depression. It's not just the person with depression who's affected by their illness. The people close to them are also affected. If you're caring for someone with depression, your relationship with them and family life in general can become strained. You may feel at a loss as to what to do. Finding a support group and talking to others in a similar situation might help. If you're having relationship or marriage difficulties, it might help to contact a relationship counsellor who can talk things through with you and your partner. Men are less likely to ask for help than women and are also more likely to turn to alcohol or drugs when depressed. Coping with bereavement. Losing someone close to you can be a trigger for depression. When someone you love dies, the sense of loss can be so powerful that you feel it's impossible to recover. However, with time and the right help and support, it's possible to start living your life again. Depression and suicide. The majority of suicide cases are linked with mental health conditions, and most of them are triggered by severe depression. Warning signs that someone with depression may be considering suicide include: making final arrangements, such as giving away possessions, making a will or saying goodbye to friends. talking about death or suicide – this may be a direct statement, such as ""I wish I was dead"", but often depressed people will talk about the subject indirectly, using phrases like ""I think dead people must be happier than us"" or ""Wouldn't it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up"". self-harm, such as cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes. a sudden lifting of mood, which could mean that a person has decided to attempt suicide and feels better because of this decision. Contact a GP as soon as possible if you're feeling suicidal or are in the crisis of depression. They'll be able to help you. If you cannot or do not want to contact a GP, call the Samaritans on 116 123 (the helpline is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year). You can also email jo@samaritans.org . Helping a suicidal friend or relative. If you see any of the above warning signs in a friend or relative: help them to get professional support. let them know they are not alone and you care about them. encourage them to talk about how they're feeling. offer support in finding other solutions to their problems. If you feel there's an immediate danger, call 999 or take them to A&E. Stay with the person or have someone else stay with them, and remove all available means of attempting suicide, such as medicine. Over-the-counter medicine, such as painkillers, can be just as dangerous as prescription medicine. Also, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach. Someone may be at increased risk when they start or change their antidepressant treatment, or when they're facing particularly stressful situations."

"Overview - Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern. SAD is sometimes known as ""winter depression "" because the symptoms are usually more apparent and more severe during the winter. Some people with SAD may have symptoms during the summer and feel better during the winter. Symptoms of SAD. Symptoms of SAD can include: a persistent low mood. a loss of pleasure or interest in normal everyday activities. irritability. feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness. feeling lethargic (lacking in energy) and sleepy during the day. sleeping for longer than normal and finding it hard to get up in the morning. craving carbohydrates and gaining weight. difficulty concentrating. decreased sex drive. For some people, these symptoms can be severe and have a significant impact on their day-to-day activities. When to see a GP. You should consider seeing the GP if you think you might have SAD and you're struggling to cope. The GP can carry out an assessment to check your mental health. They may ask you about your mood, lifestyle, eating habits and sleeping patterns, plus any seasonal changes in your thoughts and behaviour. What causes SAD? The exact cause of SAD is not fully understood, but it's often linked to reduced exposure to sunlight during the shorter autumn and winter days. The main theory is that a lack of sunlight might stop a part of the brain called the hypothalamus working properly, which may affect the: production of melatonin – melatonin is a hormone that makes you feel sleepy; in people with SAD, the body may produce it in higher than normal levels. production of serotonin – serotonin is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite and sleep; a lack of sunlight may lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to feelings of depression. body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) – your body uses sunlight to time various important functions, such as when you wake up, so lower light levels during the winter may disrupt your body clock and lead to symptoms of SAD. It's also possible that some people are more vulnerable to SAD as a result of their genes, as some cases appear to run in families. Treatments for SAD. A range of treatments are available for SAD. The GP will recommend the most suitable treatment programme for you. The main treatments are: lifestyle measures – including getting as much natural sunlight as possible, exercising regularly and managing your stress levels. light therapy – where a special lamp called a light box is used to simulate exposure to sunlight. talking therapies – such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or counselling. antidepressant medicine – such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)."
"Symptoms - Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) are similar to those of normal depression , but they occur repetitively at a particular time of year. They usually start in the autumn or winter and improve in the spring. The nature and severity of SAD varies from person to person. For some, it may be mild while for others it can be severe and have a significant impact on their day-to-day life. Depression. Signs that you may be depressed include: a persistent low mood. a loss of pleasure or interest in normal everyday activities. feeling irritable. feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness. low self-esteem. tearfulness. feeling stressed or anxious. a reduced sex drive. becoming less sociable. A small number of people will experience these symptoms in phases that are separated by ""manic"" periods where they feel happy, energetic and much more sociable. Other symptoms. In addition to symptoms of depression, you may also: be less active than normal. feel lethargic (lacking in energy) and sleepy during the day. sleep for longer than normal and find it hard to get up in the morning. find it difficult to concentrate. have an increased appetite – some people have a particular craving for foods containing lots of carbohydrates and end up gaining weight as a result. These symptoms may make everyday activities increasingly difficult. When to see a GP. You should see a GP if you think you might have SAD and you're finding it difficult to cope. There are a number of helpful treatments the GP may be able to recommend. Read more about diagnosing SAD and treating SAD"
"Diagnosis - Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Visit a GP if you have symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Effective treatments are available if you're diagnosed with the condition. The GP may carry out a psychological assessment to check your mental health. They may ask about: your mood. your lifestyle. your eating and sleeping patterns. any seasonal changes in your thoughts and behaviour. whether your symptoms prevent you from carrying out normal activities. whether there's anything in your personal or family history that may contribute to a depressive disorder, such as a family history of depression. The GP may also carry out a brief physical examination. Confirming a diagnosis of SAD. SAD can be difficult to diagnose because there are many other types of depression that have similar symptoms. It may take some time before you and a GP realise that your symptoms are forming a regular pattern. A diagnosis of SAD can usually be confirmed if: your depression occurs at a similar time each year for at least 2 years. the periods of depression are followed by periods without depression."
"Treatment - Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). A number of treatments are available for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), antidepressants and light therapy. A GP will recommend the most suitable treatment option for you, based on the nature and severity of your symptoms. This may involve using a combination of treatments to get the best results. NICE recommendations. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that SAD should be treated in the same way as other types of depression . This includes using talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or medicine, such as antidepressants . Light therapy is also a popular treatment for SAD, although NICE says it's not clear whether it's effective. See the NICE guidance, depression in adults: treatment and management . Things you can try yourself. There are a number of things you can do to help improve your symptoms: try to get as much natural sunlight as possible – even a brief lunchtime walk can be beneficial. make your work and home environments as light and airy as possible. sit near windows when you're indoors. take plenty of regular exercise, particularly outdoors and in daylight – read more about exercise for depression. eat a healthy, balanced diet. if possible, avoid stressful situations and take steps to manage stress. It can also be helpful to talk to your family and friends about SAD, so they understand how your mood changes during the winter. This can help them to support you more effectively. Talking therapies. Talking therapies focus on both psychological aspects (how your brain functions) and social aspects (how you interact with others). Cognitive behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy based on the idea that the way we think and behave affects the way we feel. Changing the way you think about situations and what you do about them can help you feel better. If you have CBT, you'll have a number of sessions with a specially trained therapist, usually over several weeks or months. Your programme could be: an individual programme of self-help. a programme designed for you and your partner (if your depression is affecting your relationship). a group programme that you complete with other people in a similar situation. a computer-based CBT programme tailored to your needs and supported by a trained therapist. Counselling and psychodynamic psychotherapy. Counselling is another type of talking therapy that involves talking to a trained counsellor about your worries and problems. During psychodynamic psychotherapy you discuss how you feel about yourself and others and talk about experiences in your past. The aim of the sessions is to find out whether anything in your past is affecting how you feel today. It's not clear exactly how effective these 2 therapies are in treating depression. Antidepressants. Antidepressants are often prescribed to treat depression and are also sometimes used to treat severe cases of SAD, although the evidence to suggest they're effective in treating SAD is limited. Antidepressants are thought to be most effective if taken at the start of winter before symptoms appear, and continued until spring. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the preferred type of antidepressant for treating SAD. They increase the level of the hormone serotonin in your brain, which can help lift your mood. If you're prescribed antidepressants, you should be aware that: it can take up to 4 to 6 weeks for the medicine to take full effect. you should take the medicine as prescribed and continue taking it until advised to gradually stop by your doctor. some antidepressants have side effects and may interact with other types of medicine you're taking. Common side effects of SSRIs include feeling agitated, shaky or anxious, an upset stomach and diarrhoea or constipation . These symptoms should improve after a few weeks. Check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects. Light therapy. Some people with SAD find that light therapy can help improve their mood considerably. This involves sitting by a special lamp called a light box, usually for around 30 minutes to an hour each morning. Light boxes come in a variety of designs, including desk lamps and wall-mounted fixtures. They produce a very bright light. The intensity of the light is measured in lux – the higher lux, the brighter the light. The light produced by the light box simulates the sunlight that's missing during the darker winter months. It's thought the light may improve SAD by encouraging your brain to reduce the production of melatonin (a hormone that makes you sleepy) and increase the production of serotonin (a hormone that affects your mood). Sunrise alarm clocks, which gradually light up your bedroom as you wake up, may also be useful for some people. Who can use light therapy? Most people can use light therapy safely. The recommended light boxes have filters that remove harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, so there's no risk of skin or eye damage for most people. However, exposure to very bright light may not be suitable if you: have an eye condition or eye damage that makes your eyes particularly sensitive to light. are taking medication that increases your sensitivity to light, such as certain antibiotics and antipsychotics, or the herbal supplement St John's Wort. Speak to a GP if you're unsure about the suitability of a particular product. Trying light therapy. Light boxes are not usually available on the NHS, so you'll need to buy one yourself if you want to try light therapy. Before using a light box, you should check the manufacturer's information and instructions regarding: whether the product is suitable for treating SAD. the light intensity you should be using. the recommended length of time you need to use the light. Make sure that you choose a light box that is medically approved for the treatment of SAD and produced by a fully certified manufacturer. Does light therapy work? There's mixed evidence regarding the overall effectiveness of light therapy, but some studies have concluded it's effective, particularly if used first thing in the morning. It's thought that light therapy is best for producing short-term results. This means it may help relieve your symptoms when they occur, but you might still be affected by SAD next winter. When light therapy has been found to help, most people noticed an improvement in their symptoms within a week or so. Side effects of light therapy. It's rare for people using light therapy to have side effects. However, some people may experience: agitation or irritability. headaches or eye strain. sleeping problems (avoiding light therapy during the evening may help prevent this). tiredness. changes to your sight, including blurred vision. These side effects are usually mild and short-lived, but you should visit a GP if you experience any particularly troublesome side effects while using light therapy."
"Tips on preparing for exams. Being well prepared for your exams is the best way to overcome stress and anxiety , and gives you the best chance of getting good grades. Revision tips. Make a realistic revision schedule. Work out how much you have to do and the time you have to do it in, then break it down into manageable chunks. Aim to do a few hours of revision each day, and mix up your subjects so you do not get bored. Find a revision style that suits you. Studying alone in a quiet room suits some people, but not everyone likes working in silence. Try playing music quietly in the background, or revising with a friend (but do not let them distract you!). Customise your notes to make them more personal. Experiment with colour coding, notes on postcards, diagrams or whatever helps you learn your topic. Make sure you understand everything. If you come across something you do not understand, try to find a new source of information that will help you understand it. Just memorising it will not help you in your exam. Do not be afraid to ask your teacher or a friend for help if you need it. Look at past exam papers. It means you can familiarise yourself with the layout and type of questions you'll be asked. Practise completing exam papers in the set time limit to improve your exam technique. Take regular short breaks. Studying for hours and hours will only make you tired and ruin your concentration, which may make you even more anxious. Reward yourself. For example, you could take a long bath, listen to music, spend time with friends or watch a good movie once you have finished your revision session. Do something physical. When you're not revising, use your spare time to get away from your books and do something active, like going for a walk or doing some stretching. Exercise is good for taking your mind off stress and keeping you positive, and it will help you sleep better. Ask for help. If you're feeling stressed, it's important to talk to someone you trust, such as a family member, teacher or a friend. Lots of people find exams difficult to deal with, so do not be embarrassed to ask for support. How to handle exam days. Be prepared. Start the day with a good breakfast, and give yourself plenty of time to get to the exam hall. Remember to take everything you need, including pencils, pens and a calculator. A bottle of water and some tissues are also useful. Try a breathing exercise if you're feeling overwhelmed. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts, hold it for 2 counts, and breathe out for 7 counts. Repeating this can help you feel calm.  Take a few minutes to read the instructions and questions. Then you'll know exactly what's expected of you. Ask an exam supervisor if anything is unclear – they're there to help you. Plan how much time you'll need for each question. Do not panic if you get stuck on a question, but try to leave yourself enough time at the end to come back to it. Once the exam is finished, forget about it. Do not spend too much time going over it in your head or comparing answers with your friends. Just focus on the next exam instead.

"Bereavement and young people. Losing someone important to you is one of the hardest things to experience in life. If you're young, bereavement can be even more difficult. But support and advice are available to help you get through it. Your teenage years can be a lot of fun, but they are also often an emotional time. If someone close to you dies, it can be incredibly hard. Your world may feel as though it has crashed down around you. It can make you feel very alone, especially as a young person, because you might find that none of your friends have gone through anything similar and won't understand or know what to say. Your emotions after a bereavement. Grieving is a natural part of recovering from a bereavement, and everyone's experience of grief is different. There are no rules about what we should feel, and for how long. But many people find they feel a mixture of the following: sadness. shock, particularly if the death was unexpected. relief, if the death followed a long period of illness. guilt and regret. anger. anxiety. despair and helplessness. depression. These feelings may be very intense, particularly in the early days and weeks. Time eventually helps these intense emotions subside, and there's no need to feel guilty about starting to feel better. It doesn't mean you're not respecting the person's memory or forgetting about them. Your family may all react differently to a bereavement. You may find it difficult to see your parents or other adults grieving and not know what to say to them. You could try just letting them know you're there for them too while you get support yourself. There are several things that can help you start to feel better. Looking after your health and talking to someone will help you get through this difficult time. Finding support for bereavement. Talking about your grief is an important part of getting through a bereavement. Choosing who to talk to about your feelings is a very personal decision. Sometimes the most unlikely person can actually offer the most support. If you've lost a family member, someone else in your family may also be good to open up to because they're likely to understand how you're feeling. A close friend can be a good listener and a source of comfort and support, even if they haven't gone through this themselves. There are lots of other sources of advice and support available, including: websites and blogs – such as Hope Again, a website for young people going through a bereavement, where you can find information, read other people's experiences and add your own; and the Winston's Wish, Child Bereavement UK and Health for Teens websites, which also offer information and advice. helplines – such as the Cruse Bereavement helpline on 0808 808 1677. your GP – especially if you're concerned you're not coping, might be depressed, have trouble eating or sleeping, are thinking about hurting yourself, or you're not starting to feel better after a few months: they may suggest you have counselling. a teacher or tutor – you may be distracted or find it hard to concentrate at school or college for a while, so talking to a teacher you feel comfortable with can help them understand what you're going through and take a bit of pressure off you; special circumstances, such as bereavement, can sometimes be taken into account if you're having trouble with coursework or exams. Looking after yourself during a bereavement. During a time of grief you may not feel like looking after yourself, but it's important to help you cope with the extreme emotions that come with bereavement. Some of the following quite simple things can make a big difference, such as: eating – you may lose your appetite, but try to keep eating as normally as possible: your body needs food, even if you don't want it; ideally, go for healthy, well-balanced meals. sleeping – it can be hard to sleep when you're very upset, but there are some things that can help: read more about insomnia. socialising – seeing your friends and keeping up a normal social life may help take your mind off things and allow you to talk about how you're doing, if you want to; but don't feel guilty about not thinking about the person you've lost or having a good laugh with friends. exercising – regular exercise can make you feel good and help you sleep (but avoid doing vigorous exercise close to bedtime); it can also be a relief to focus on something physical when you're going through an emotional time. avoiding smoking, drinking and taking drugs – you may feel like smoking or drinking because you feel down, but your body has to work hard to deal with substances such as nicotine, alcohol or illegal drugs, especially when you're young, and they'll end up making you feel worse.

"Personality disorders. A person with a personality disorder thinks, feels, behaves or relates to others very differently from the average person. There are several different types of personality disorder. This page gives some information about personality disorders in general, linking to other sources for more detail. Symptoms of a personality disorder. Symptoms vary depending on the type of personality disorder. For example, a person with borderline personality disorder (one of the most common types) tends to have disturbed ways of thinking, impulsive behaviour and problems controlling their emotions. They may have intense but unstable relationships and worry about people abandoning them. A person with antisocial personality disorder will typically get easily frustrated and have difficulty controlling their anger. They may blame other people for problems in their life, and be aggressive and violent, upsetting others with their behaviour. Someone with a personality disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression and drug addiction . Other types of personality disorder will have different symptoms. Information: Mild, moderate and severe personality disorders. The way personality disorders are diagnosed is changing. Instead of being diagnosed with a type of personality disorder (such as borderline personality disorder), you may be diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe personality disorder. A mental health professional can talk to you about what your diagnosis means. Treatment for a personality disorder. Treatment for a personality disorder usually involves a talking therapy and can also include other types of therapy and medicine. Talking therapies. This is where the person talks to a therapist to get a better understanding of their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Treatment can last several months or years, depending on the severity of the condition and other problems the person may have. As well as listening and discussing important issues with the person, the therapist may identify strategies to resolve problems and, if necessary, help them change their attitudes and behaviour. Therapeutic communities. Treatment at a therapeutic community may be offered to some people with personality disorders. Therapeutic communities (TCs) are places where someone visits or stays for an intensive form of group therapy. The experience of having a personality disorder is explored in depth. The person usually attends for a number of weeks or months. Medicine. Medicine may be prescribed to treat problems associated with a personality disorder, such as depression , anxiety or psychotic symptoms . For example, moderate to severe symptoms of depression might be treated with a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) .  Information: Find out more about treatments for personality disorders: Mind. Rethink Mental Illness. Recovery. Many people with a personality disorder recover over time. Psychological or medical treatment is often helpful, but support is sometimes all that's needed. There's no single approach that suits everyone – treatment should be tailored to the individual. Causes. It's not clear exactly what causes personality disorders, but they're thought to result from a combination of the genes a person inherits and early environmental influences – for example, a distressing childhood experience (such as abuse or neglect). Pregnancy, becoming a parent and personality disorders. If you have a personality disorder, you may need extra support during your pregnancy and after your child is born. You can speak to a GP, midwife or health visitor if you would like support. Find out more about mental health in pregnancy. Support for people living with a personality disorder. Having a personality disorder can have a big effect on the person's life, as well as their family and friends, but support is available.

"Overview - Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others. It's the most commonly recognised personality disorder. In general, someone with a personality disorder will differ significantly from an average person in terms of how he or she thinks, perceives, feels or relates to others. Symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). The symptoms of BPD can be grouped into 4 main areas: emotional instability – the psychological term for this is affective dysregulation. disturbed patterns of thinking or perception – cognitive distortions or perceptual distortions. impulsive behaviour. intense but unstable relationships with others. The symptoms of a personality disorder may range from mild to severe and usually emerge in adolescence, persisting into adulthood. Causes of borderline personality disorder (BPD). The causes of BPD are unclear. BPD appears to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People with BPD come from many different backgrounds, but most will have experienced some kind of trauma or neglect as children. When to get medical advice. If you're experiencing symptoms of BPD, make an appointment with a GP. They may ask about: how you feel. your recent behaviour. what sort of impact your symptoms have had on your quality of life. This is to rule out other more common mental health conditions, such as depression , and to make sure there's no immediate risk to your health and wellbeing. You may also find Mind a useful website. Treating borderline personality disorder (BPD). Many people with BPD can benefit from psychological or medical treatment. Treatment may involve a range of individual and group psychological therapies (psychotherapy) carried out by trained professionals working with a community mental health team (CMHT). Effective treatment may last more than a year. Over time, many people with BPD overcome their symptoms and recover. Additional treatment is recommended for people whose symptoms return. Associated mental health problems. Many people with BPD also have another mental health condition or behavioural problem, such as: misusing alcohol. generalised anxiety disorder. bipolar disorder. depression. misusing drugs. an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia. another personality disorder, such as antisocial personality disorder. BPD can be a serious condition, and many people with the condition self-harm and attempt suicide . Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled, including family members. Our guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support."
"Diagnosis - Borderline personality disorder. See your GP if you're concerned that you have borderline personality disorder (BPD). They may ask about your symptoms and how they're affecting your quality of life. Your GP will also want to rule out other more common mental health conditions, such as depression , and make sure there's no immediate risk to your health and wellbeing. If your GP suspects BPD, you'll probably be referred to your local community mental health team (CMHT) for a more in-depth assessment. Ask if the service you're being referred to has experience of working with personality disorders. You may also find the Mind website useful. Community mental health team (CMHT). A CMHT helps people with complex mental health conditions such as BPD. However, some teams may focus only on people with psychotic disorders. In other areas, there are complex needs services that may be better placed to help you. Your assessment will probably be carried out by a specialist in personality disorders, usually a psychologist or psychiatrist. The assessment will involve being asked about your thoughts and feelings, what you feel you are good at and where you have difficulty, and how you're managing day to day. Involving your family. Once a diagnosis of BPD has been confirmed, it's recommended that you tell close family, friends and people you trust about the diagnosis. There are several reasons for this. Many of the symptoms of BPD affect your relationships with people close to you, so involving them in your treatment may make them aware of your condition and make your treatment more effective. Your family and friends can then remain alert for any behaviour that may indicate you're having a crisis. They may also benefit from local support groups and other services for people in a relationship with a person with BPD. However, the decision to talk about your condition is entirely your own, and your confidentiality will be respected at all times."
"Symptoms - Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) can cause a wide range of symptoms, which can be broadly grouped into 4 main areas. The 4 areas are: emotional instability – the psychological term for this is ""affective dysregulation"". disturbed patterns of thinking or perception – ""cognitive distortions"" or ""perceptual distortions"". impulsive behaviour. intense but unstable relationships with others. Each of these areas is described in more detail below. Emotional instability. If you have BPD, you may experience a range of often intense negative emotions, such as: rage. sorrow. shame. panic. terror. long-term feelings of emptiness and loneliness. You may have severe mood swings over a short space of time. It's common for people with BPD to feel suicidal with despair, and then feel reasonably positive a few hours later. Some people feel better in the morning and some in the evening. The pattern varies, but the key sign is that your moods swing in unpredictable ways. If you have suicidal thoughts: call your GP or the out-of-hours GP service. If you've taken an overdose or self-harmed, dial 999. call the Samaritans on 116 123. This organisation provides emotional support 24 hours a day for people experiencing feelings of distress or despair. contact a friend, family member or someone you trust. If you've been diagnosed with BPD, tell someone you trust about your condition. Give this person the contact details of your care team and ask him or her to contact the team if they become concerned about your behaviour. Disturbed patterns of thinking. Different types of thoughts can affect people with BPD, including: upsetting thoughts – such as thinking you're a terrible person or feeling you do not exist. You may not be sure of these thoughts and may seek reassurance that they're not true. brief episodes of strange experiences – such as hearing voices outside your head for minutes at a time. These may often feel like instructions to harm yourself or others. You may or may not be certain whether these are real. prolonged episodes of abnormal experiences – where you might experience both hallucinations (voices outside your head) and distressing beliefs that no one can talk you out of (such as believing your family are secretly trying to kill you). These types of beliefs may be psychotic and a sign you're becoming more unwell. It's important to get help if you're struggling with delusions. Impulsive behaviour. If you have BPD, there are 2 main types of impulses you may find extremely difficult to control: an impulse to self-harm – such as cutting your arms with razors or burning your skin with cigarettes; in severe cases, especially if you also feel intensely sad and depressed, this impulse can lead to feeling suicidal and attempting suicide. a strong impulse to engage in reckless and irresponsible activities – such as binge drinking, drug misuse, going on a spending or gambling spree, or having unprotected sex with strangers. Unstable relationships. If you have BPD, you may feel that other people abandon you when you most need them, or that they get too close and smother you. When people fear abandonment, it can lead to feelings of intense anxiety and anger. You may make frantic efforts to prevent being left alone, such as: constantly texting or phoning a person. suddenly calling that person in the middle of the night. physically clinging on to that person and refusing to let go. making threats to harm or kill yourself if that person ever leaves you. Alternatively, you may feel others are smothering, controlling or crowding you, which also provokes intense fear and anger. You may then respond by acting in ways to make people go away, such as emotionally withdrawing, rejecting them or using verbal abuse. These 2 patterns may result in an unstable ""love-hate"" relationship with certain people. Many people with BPD seem to be stuck with a very rigid ""black-white"" view of relationships. Either a relationship is perfect and that person is wonderful, or the relationship is doomed and that person is terrible. People with BPD seem unable or unwilling to accept any sort of ""grey area"" in their personal life and relationships. For many people with BPD, emotional relationships (including relationships with professional carers) involve ""go away/please don't go"" states of mind, which is confusing for them and their partners. Sadly, this can often lead to break-ups."
"Causes - Borderline personality disorder. There's no single cause of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and it's likely to be caused by a combination of factors. Genetics. Genes you inherit from your parents may make you more vulnerable to developing BPD as there is evidence that the condition can run in families. Problem with brain chemicals. It's thought that many people with BPD have something wrong with the neurotransmitters in their brain, particularly serotonin. Neurotransmitters are ""messenger chemicals"" used by your brain to transmit signals between brain cells. Altered levels of serotonin have been linked to depression, aggression and difficulty controlling destructive urges. Problem with brain development. Researchers have used MRI to study the brains of people with BPD. MRI scans use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of the body. The scans revealed that in many people with BPD, 3 parts of the brain were either smaller than expected or had unusual levels of activity. These parts were: the amygdala – which plays an important role in regulating emotions, especially the more ""negative"" emotions, such as fear, aggression and anxiety. the hippocampus – which helps regulate behaviour and self-control. the orbitofrontal cortex – which is involved in planning and decision making. Problems with these parts of the brain may well contribute to symptoms of BPD. The development of these parts of the brain is affected by your early upbringing. These parts of your brain are also responsible for mood regulation, which may account for some of the problems people with BPD have in close relationships. Environmental factors. A number of environmental factors seem to be common and widespread among people with BPD. These include: being a victim of emotional, physical or sexual abuse. being exposed to long-term fear or distress as a child. being neglected by 1 or both parents. growing up with another family member who had a serious mental health condition, such as bipolar disorder or a drink or drug misuse problem."
"Treatment - Borderline personality disorder. Over time, many people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) overcome their symptoms and recover. Additional treatment is recommended for people whose symptoms return. Treatment for BPD may involve individual or group psychotherapy, carried out by professionals within a community mental health team (CMHT). The goal of a CMHT is to provide day-to-day support and treatment, while ensuring you have as much independence as possible. A CMHT can be made up of: social workers. community mental health nurses (who have specialist training in mental health conditions). pharmacists. counsellors and psychotherapists. psychologists and psychiatrists (the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the team). occupational therapists. Care programme approach (CPA). If your symptoms are moderate to severe, you'll probably be entered into a treatment process known as a care programme approach (CPA). CPA is essentially a way of ensuring that you receive the right treatment for your needs. There are 4 stages: an assessment of your health and social needs. a care plan – created to meet your health and social needs. the appointment of a care co-ordinator (keyworker) – usually a social worker or nurse and your first point of contact with other members of the CMHT. reviews – where your treatment is regularly reviewed and any necessary changes to the care plan can be agreed. Psychotherapy. Treatment for BPD usually involves some type of psychological therapy, also known as psychotherapy . There are lots of different types of psychotherapy, but they all involve taking time to help you get a better understanding of how you think and feel. As well as listening and discussing important issues with you, the psychotherapist can suggest ways to resolve problems and, if necessary, help you change your attitudes and behaviour. Therapy for BPD aims to help people get a better sense of control over their thoughts and feelings. Psychotherapy for BPD should only be delivered by a trained professional. They'll usually be a psychiatrist, psychologist or other trained mental health professional. Do not be afraid to ask about their experience. The type of psychotherapy you choose may be based on a combination of personal preference and the availability of specific treatments in your local area. Treatment for BPD may last a year or longer, depending on your needs and how you live your life. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of therapy specifically designed to treat people with BPD. DBT is based on the idea that 2 important factors contribute towards BPD: you are particularly emotionally vulnerable – for example, low levels of stress make you feel extremely anxious. you grew up in an environment where your emotions were dismissed by those around you – for example, a parent may have told you that you had no right to feel sad or you were just ""being silly"" if you complained of feelings of anxiety or stress. These 2 factors may cause you to fall into a negative cycle – you experience intense and upsetting emotions, yet feel guilty and worthless for having these emotions. Because of your upbringing, you think having these emotions makes you a bad person. These thoughts then lead to further upsetting emotions. The goal of DBT is to break this cycle by introducing 2 important concepts: validation: accepting your emotions are valid, real and acceptable. dialectics: a school of philosophy that says most things in life are rarely ""black or white"" and that it's important to be open to ideas and opinions that contradict your own. The DBT therapist will use both concepts to try to bring about positive changes in your behaviour. For example, the therapist could accept (validate) that feelings of intense sadness cause you to self-harm , and that behaving in such a way does not make you a terrible and worthless person. However, the therapist would then attempt to challenge the assumption that self-harming is the only way to cope with feelings of sadness. The ultimate goal of DBT is to help you ""break free"" of seeing the world, your relationships and your life in a very narrow, rigid way that leads you to engage in harmful and self-destructive behaviour. DBT usually involves weekly individual and group sessions, and you'll be given an out-of-hours contact number to call if your symptoms get worse. DBT is based on teamwork. You'll be expected to work with your therapist and the other people in your group sessions. In turn, the therapists work together as a team. DBT has proved particularly effective in treating women with BPD who have a history of self-harming and suicidal behaviour. It's been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as the first treatment for these women to try. Visit Mind to find more information about DBT . Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT). Another type of long-term psychotherapy that can be used to treat BPD is mentalisation-based therapy (MBT). MBT is based on the concept that people with BPD have a poor capacity to mentalise. Mentalisation is the ability to think about thinking. This means examining your own thoughts and beliefs, and assessing whether they're useful, realistic and based on reality. For example, many people with BPD will have a sudden urge to self-harm and then fulfil that urge without questioning it. They lack the ability to ""step back"" from that urge and say to themselves: ""That's not a healthy way of thinking and I'm only thinking this way because I'm upset."" Another important part of mentalisation is to recognise that other people have their own thoughts, emotions, beliefs, wishes and needs, and your interpretation of other people's mental states may not necessarily be correct. In addition, you need to be aware of the potential impact your actions will have on other people's mental states. The goal of MBT is to improve your ability to recognise your own and others' mental states, learn to ""step back"" from your thoughts about yourself and others and examine them to see if they're valid. Initially, MBT may be delivered in a hospital, where you would stay as an inpatient. The treatment usually consists of daily individual sessions with a therapist and group sessions with other people with BPD. A course of MBT usually lasts around 18 months. Some hospitals and specialist centres encourage you to remain as an inpatient during this time. Other hospitals and centres may recommend that you leave the hospital after a certain period of time but remain being treated as an outpatient, where you visit the hospital regularly. Therapeutic communities (TCs). Therapeutic communities (TCs) are structured environments where people with a range of complex psychological conditions and needs come together to interact and take part in therapy. TCs are designed to help people with long-standing emotional problems and a history of self-harming by teaching them skills needed to interact socially with others. Most TCs are residential, such as in large houses, where you stay for around 1 to 4 days a week. As well as taking part in individual and group therapy, you would be expected to do other activities designed to improve your social skills and self-confidence, such as: household chores. meal preparation. games, sports and other recreational activities. regular community meetings – where people discuss any issues that have arisen in the community. TCs are run on a democratic basis. This means that each resident and staff member has a vote on how the TC should be run, including whether a person is suitable for admission to that community. Even if your care team thinks you may benefit from spending time in a TC, it does not automatically mean the TC will allow you to join. Many TCs set guidelines on what is considered acceptable behaviour within the community, such as not drinking alcohol, no violence to other residents or staff, and no attempts at self-harming. Those who break these guidelines are usually told to leave the TC. While some people with BPD have reported that the time spent in a TC helped their symptoms, there's not yet enough evidence to tell whether TCs would help everyone with BPD. Also, because of the often strict rules on behaviour, a TC would probably not be suitable if a person were having significant difficulties controlling their behaviour. Arts therapies. Arts or creative therapies may be offered individually or with a group as part of a treatment programme for people with BPD. Therapies may include: art therapy. dance movement therapy. drama therapy. music therapy. Arts therapies aim to help people who are finding it hard to express their thoughts and feelings verbally. The therapy focuses on creating something as a way of expressing your feelings. The courses are run by trained therapists, who can help you to think about what you've created and whether it relates to your thoughts and experiences. A course of arts therapy usually involves weekly sessions, which last up to 2 hours. Treating a crisis. You'll probably be given several telephone numbers to use if you think you may be experiencing a crisis (when symptoms are particularly severe and you have an increased risk of self-harm). One of these numbers is likely to be your community mental health nurse. Other numbers may include an out-of-hours number for social workers and your local crisis resolution team (CRT). Crisis resolution teams support people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric crisis, which would require hospitalisation without the team's involvement. An example of a severe psychiatric crisis would be a suicide attempt. People with BPD often find that simply talking to somebody who understands their condition can help bring them out of a crisis. In a small number of cases, you may be given a short course of medicine, such as a tranquilliser, to calm your mood. This medicine is usually prescribed for 7 days. If your symptoms are particularly severe and it's thought you pose a significant risk to your own health, you may be admitted to hospital – very occasionally via detention under the Mental Health Act, if you're unable to make appropriate decisions about your safety. This will be for as short a time as possible and you should be able to return home once your symptoms improve. Doctors do their best to avoid detaining anyone unless it's absolutely essential. Medicine. Experts are divided over whether medicine is helpful. No medicine is currently licensed to treat BPD. While medicine isn't recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, there's evidence that it may be helpful for certain problems in some people. Medicines are often used if you have another associated mental health condition, such as: depression. anxiety disorder. bipolar disorder. Mood stabilisers or antipsychotics are sometimes prescribed to help mood swings, alleviate psychotic symptoms or reduce impulsive behaviour."
"Antisocial personality disorder. Personality disorders are mental health conditions that affect how someone thinks, perceives, feels or relates to others. Antisocial personality disorder is a particularly challenging type of personality disorder characterised by impulsive, irresponsible and often criminal behaviour. Someone with antisocial personality disorder will typically be manipulative, deceitful and reckless, and will not care for other people's feelings. Like other types of personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder is on a spectrum, which means it can range in severity from occasional bad behaviour to repeatedly breaking the law and committing serious crimes. Psychopaths are considered to have a severe form of antisocial personality disorder. Signs of antisocial personality disorder. A person with antisocial personality disorder may: exploit, manipulate or violate the rights of others. lack concern, regret or remorse about other people's distress. behave irresponsibly and show disregard for normal social behaviour. have difficulty sustaining long-term relationships. be unable to control their anger. lack guilt, or not learn from their mistakes. blame others for problems in their lives. repeatedly break the law. A person with antisocial personality disorder will have a history of conduct disorder during childhood, such as truancy (not going to school), delinquency (for example, committing crimes or substance misuse), and other disruptive and aggressive behaviours. Who develops antisocial personality disorder? Antisocial personality disorder affects more men than women. It's not known why some people develop antisocial personality disorder, but both genetics and traumatic childhood experiences, such as child abuse or neglect, are thought to play a role. A person with antisocial personality disorder will have often grown up in difficult family circumstances. One or both parents may misuse alcohol , and parental conflict and harsh, inconsistent parenting are common. As a result of these problems, social services may become involved with the child's care. These types of difficulties in childhood will often lead to behavioural problems during adolescence and adulthood. Effects of antisocial personality disorder. Criminal behaviour is a key feature of antisocial personality disorder, and there's a high risk that someone with the disorder will commit crimes and be imprisoned at some point in their life. Men with antisocial personality disorder have been found to be 3 to 5 times more likely than women to misuse alcohol and drugs than those without the disorder. They also have an increased risk of dying prematurely as a result of reckless behaviour or attempting suicide . People with antisocial personality disorder are also more likely to have relationship problems during adulthood and be unemployed and homeless. Diagnosing antisocial personality disorder. To be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a person will usually have a history of conduct personality disorder before the age of 15. Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed after rigorous detailed psychological assessment. A diagnosis can only be made if the person is aged 18 years or older and at least 3 of the following criteria behaviours apply: repeatedly breaking the law. repeatedly being deceitful. being impulsive or incapable of planning ahead. being irritable and aggressive. having a reckless disregard for their safety or the safety of others. being consistently irresponsible. lack of remorse. These signs are not part of a schizophrenic or manic episode – they're part of a person's everyday personality and behaviour. This behaviour usually becomes most extreme and challenging during the late teens and early 20 s. It may improve by the time the person reaches their 40 s. Treating antisocial personality disorder. In the past, antisocial personality disorder was thought to be a lifelong disorder, but that's not always the case and it can sometimes be managed and treated. Evidence suggests behaviour can improve over time with therapy, even if core characteristics such as lack of empathy remain. But antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult types of personality disorders to treat. A person with antisocial personality disorder may also be reluctant to seek treatment and may only start therapy when ordered to do so by a court. The recommended treatment for someone with antisocial personality disorder will depend on their circumstances, taking into account factors such as age, offending history and whether there are any associated problems, such as alcohol or drug misuse. The person's family and friends will often play an active role in making decisions about their treatment and care. Sometimes, substance misuse services and social care may also need to be involved. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is sometimes used to treat antisocial personality disorder. It's a talking therapy that aims to help a person manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is another type of talking therapy that's becoming more popular in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder. The therapist will encourage the person to consider the way they think and how their mental state affects their behaviour. Democratic therapeutic communities (DTC). Evidence suggests community-based programmes can be an effective long-term treatment method for people with antisocial personality disorder, and is becoming increasingly popular in prisons. DTC is a type of social therapy that aims to address the person's risk of offending, as well as their emotional and psychological needs. It's based around large and small therapy groups and focuses on community issues, creating an environment where both staff and prisoners contribute to the decisions of the community. There may also be opportunities for educational and vocational work. The recommended length of treatment is 18 months, as there needs to be enough time for a person to make changes and put new skills into practice. Self-motivation is another important factor for acceptance on to this type of scheme. For example, the person must be willing to work as part of a community, participate in groups, and be subject to the democratic process. Medicine. There's little evidence to support the use of medicine for treating antisocial personality disorder, but certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines may be helpful in some instances. Carbamazepine and lithium may help control symptoms such as aggression and impulsive behaviour, and a class of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve anger and general personality disorder symptoms. Further information. Personality disorders."
"Cautions - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aren't suitable for everyone. They can cause problems if you have other health conditions or if they're taken alongside other medicines. Some of the issues you and your doctor will need to bear in mind when taking SSRIs, or when considering using them, include: Medical conditions. SSRIs may not be suitable if you have any of the following conditions: bipolar disorder and you're in a manic phase (a period of extremely excitable mood), although they can be useful for depressive phases. a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia. type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. epilepsy – SSRIs should only be taken if your epilepsy is well controlled, and they should be stopped if your epilepsy gets worse. narrow angle glaucoma. serious kidney, liver or heart problems. SSRIs may need to be used with caution or not at all if you have one of these conditions, because the medicine could increase your chance of experiencing serious side effects. Pregnancy. If you're pregnant and think you may be depressed, you should discuss the risks and benefits of using SSRIs with your doctor. You should also speak to your doctor for advice if you become pregnant while you're taking SSRIs. As a precaution, SSRIs aren't usually recommended during pregnancy, particularly during the first 3 months (the first trimester). This is because there may be a risk to the baby. However, exceptions can be made if the risk posed by depression (or another mental health condition) outweighs the potential risks of treatment. Possible risks of taking SSRIs during pregnancy include: loss of the pregnancy. birth defects affecting the baby’s heart (congenital heart disease). the baby being born with a rare condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN), which causes breathing and circulation problems. Breastfeeding. If you're prescribed SSRIs when breastfeeding, paroxetine or sertraline are usually recommended and are considered safe to use. However, other SSRIs may be used if it's thought that the benefits of treatment and benefits of breastfeeding your baby outweigh the potential risks. Children and young people. SSRIs aren't usually recommended for children and young people under the age of 18. This is because there's evidence of an increased risk of self-harm and thoughts about suicide in this age group. There are also concerns that the use of SSRIs could affect brain development in children and young people. However, children and young people under the age of 18 may be offered an SSRI if talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , alone haven't helped, or as a treatment to be used alongside talking therapies. An SSRI will only be prescribed in addition to a talking therapy and treatment must be supervised by a psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions). If an SSRI is recommended, fluoxetine is usually the first choice. Driving and operating machinery. Some SSRIs can cause dizziness , drowsiness and blurred vision, particularly when you first start taking them. If you do experience these symptoms, you shouldn't drive or use heavy tools and machinery. The symptoms should be temporary, but speak to your doctor if you're unsure. Interactions with other medicines. SSRIs can react unpredictably with certain other medicines (known as ""interacting""), potentially increasing the risk of side effects such as bleeding or a problem known as ""serotonin syndrome"". Some of the medicines that can interact with some SSRIs include: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – a common type of painkiller that includes ibuprofen, diclofenac or naproxen. antiplatelets – a type of medicine used to prevent blood clots, such as low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel. theophylline – a medicine used to treat asthma. clozapine and pimozide – medicines used to treat schizophrenia and psychosis. lithium – a medicine used to treat severe depression and bipolar disorder. triptans – a type of medicine, such as naratriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan, used to treat migraines. other antidepressants – including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, this isn't an exhaustive list of all the medicines that can interact with SSRIs, and not all of these interactions apply to all types of SSRI. You should always make sure you carefully read the patient information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medicine to see if there are any medicines you should avoid. If in doubt, your pharmacist or GP should be able to advise you. Interactions with food and drink. Alcohol isn't usually recommended if you're taking an SSRI, because it can increase any drowsiness you may experience and can make feelings of depression worse. The SSRI, fluvoxamine, is also known to enhance the effects of caffeine, so people who drink large amounts of caffeine may experience unpleasant symptoms such as heart palpitations , feeling sick, restlessness and insomnia . You should therefore avoid drinking large amounts of caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee, energy drinks and cola, while taking fluvoxamine. St John's wort. St John's wort is a popular herbal remedy promoted for the treatment of depression. While there's some evidence that St John's wort may help mild to moderate depression, many experts advise against using it because the amount of active ingredient can vary significantly and you can never be sure what sort of effect it will have on you. Taking St John's wort alongside SSRIs can also potentially cause serious health problems."
"Dosage - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). When prescribing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), your doctor will usually select the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. This approach is intended to reduce the risk of side effects. If the prescribed dose proves ineffective, it can be gradually increased. SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. Depending on the type of SSRI prescribed and the severity of your depression, you'll usually have to take 1 to 3 tablets, once a day. It will usually take 2 to 4 weeks before you begin to notice the effects of SSRIs. You'll have regular meetings with your doctor when you first start taking SSRIs and you should let them know if you haven't noticed any improvement after 4 to 6 weeks. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. It's usually recommended that a course of SSRIs continues for at least 6 months after you feel better, to prevent your condition coming back when you stop. However, if you've experienced previous episodes of depression, a 2-year course may be recommended. Some people with recurring problems are advised to carry on taking medicine indefinitely. Missed or extra doses. It's important not to miss any of your doses, because this could make your treatment less effective. If you do miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time to take your next dose, in which case you should just skip the missed dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for the one you missed. If you take more tablets than prescribed, contact your GP as soon as possible for advice. If this isn't possible, contact your local out of hours service , or call NHS 111 . Taking a double dose is unlikely to be harmful, but you should only do so if advised by a medical professional. Stopping SSRIs. You shouldn't suddenly stop taking SSRIs, even if you feel better. Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as: stomach ache. flu-like symptoms. anxiety. dizziness. sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks. seizures (fits). If your GP or mental health specialist decides to stop your course of SSRIs, they'll reduce the dose gradually over a few weeks."
"Side effects - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be troublesome at first, but most improve with time. In general, SSRIs are better tolerated than most other types of antidepressants . The majority of people will only experience a few mild side effects when taking them. It's important to persist with treatment, even if you're affected by side effects, as it will take several weeks before you begin to benefit from treatment. With time, you should find that the benefits of treatment outweigh problems related to side effects. You'll usually see your doctor every few weeks when you first start taking SSRIs to discuss how well the medicine is working. However, you can contact your doctor at any point if you experience any particularly troublesome or persistent side effects. For information about the side effects of a particular SSRI, check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Common side effects. Common side effects of SSRIs can include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious. feeling or being sick. indigestion. diarrhoea or constipation. loss of appetite and weight loss. dizziness. blurred vision. dry mouth. excessive sweating. sleeping problems (insomnia) or drowsiness. headaches. loss of libido (reduced sex drive). difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation. in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). These side effects should improve over time, although some – such as sexual problems – can persist. Less common side effects. Less common side effects of SSRIs can include: bruising or bleeding easily, including vomiting blood or bleeding from your bottom. confusion. movement problems, such as stiffness or shaking. seeing or hearing things that aren't real (hallucinations). being unable to pee. Contact 111 or go to A&E immediately if you have any of these symptoms. Serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially serious, set of side effects linked to SSRIs. Serotonin syndrome occurs when the levels of a chemical in your brain called serotonin become too high. It's usually triggered when you take an SSRI in combination with another medicine (or substance) that also raises serotonin levels, such as another antidepressant or St John's wort. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome can include: confusion. agitation. muscle twitching. sweating. shivering. diarrhoea. If you experience these symptoms, you should stop taking the medicine and seek immediate advice from your GP or specialist. If this isn't possible, call NHS 111 . Symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome include: a high temperature of 38 C or above. seizures (fits). irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). loss of consciousness. If you or someone you know experiences symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome, seek emergency medical help immediately by dialling 999 and asking for an ambulance. Hyponatraemia. Elderly people who take SSRIs may experience a severe fall in sodium (salt) levels known as hyponatremia. This may lead to a build-up of fluid inside the body's cells, which can be potentially dangerous. This side effect occurs because SSRIs can block the effects of a hormone that helps to regulate levels of sodium and fluid in the body. Elderly people are vulnerable because fluid levels become more difficult for the body to regulate. Mild hyponatremia can cause symptoms similar to depression or side effects of SSRIs, such as: feeling sick. headache. muscle pain. reduced appetite. confusion. More severe hyponatremia can cause the following symptoms: feeling listless and tired. disorientation. agitation. psychosis. seizures (fits). The most serious cases of hyponatremia can cause you to stop breathing or go into a coma . If you suspect that you or someone in your care has mild hyponatremia, call your GP or contact 111 for advice and stop taking SSRIs for the time being. If you suspect severe hyponatremia, call 999 to ask for an ambulance. Hyponatremia can be treated by feeding a sodium solution into the body through an intravenous drip. Suicidal thoughts. Some people have suicidal thoughts and a desire to self-harm when they first take SSRIs. Young people under 25 seem particularly at risk. Contact your GP or go to hospital immediately if you have thoughts of killing or harming yourself at any time while you're taking SSRIs. It may be useful to tell a relative or close friend that you've started taking antidepressants and ask them to read the leaflet that comes with your medicine. Ask them to tell you if they think your symptoms are getting worse, or if they're worried about changes in your behaviour. Reporting side effects. The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking. It's run by the medicines safety watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) ."

"Cautions - Antidepressants. There are several important things to consider when taking antidepressants. You should discuss these with a GP or mental health professional. Interactions with other medicines. Antidepressants can react unpredictably with other medicines, including some over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen . Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if there are any other medicines you should avoid. If in doubt, your pharmacist or GP should be able to advise you. Pregnancy. As a precaution, antidepressants are not usually recommended for most pregnant women, especially during the early stages of a pregnancy. This is because there might be risks for you or your baby. But it's important that depression is well treated because it can affect both you and your baby's wellbeing. Depression and anxiety can sometimes get worse during pregnancy and after your baby is born. Speak to your doctor, who will help you understand the risks and benefits so you can decide on the best treatment for you and your baby. Breastfeeding. Some antidepressants can be taken while breastfeeding if your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy. Speak to your doctor, who will help you understand the risks and benefits so you can decide on the best treatment for you and your baby. Children and young people. The use of antidepressants is not usually recommended in children and young people under the age of 18. This is because there is some evidence that, in rare cases, they can trigger thoughts about suicide and acts of self-harm in this age group. Antidepressants are not recommended for the initial treatment of mild depression in children and young people. For moderate to severe depression, antidepressants may be used if both the following apply: the person being treated will also receive talking therapies in combination with antidepressants. the treatment is supervised by a child and adolescent psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions in children). Alcohol. You should be wary of drinking alcohol if you're taking antidepressants, as alcohol is itself a depressant and drinking alcohol can make your symptoms worse. If you drink alcohol while taking types of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), you may become drowsy and dizzy. You're less likely to experience unpleasant or unpredictable effects if you drink alcohol while taking an SSRI or a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant, but avoiding alcohol is often still recommended. Illegal drugs. The use of illegal drugs is not recommended if you're taking antidepressants, particularly if you've been prescribed a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). This is because they can cause unpredictable and unpleasant effects. In particular, you should avoid taking: cannabis – smoking cannabis while taking a TCA can make you feel very ill. amphetamines (speed). cocaine. heroin. ketamine. As with alcohol, illegal drugs can make symptoms of depression or other mental health conditions worse. Other antidepressants. You should only take 2 different types of antidepressants, such as an SSRI and a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), if a doctor advises you to. This is because taking certain combinations of antidepressants can make you feel very ill and can be life-threatening. If a decision is taken to switch you from a particular type to another, the dosage of the first antidepressant will usually be gradually reduced before the second is started. St John's wort. St John's wort is a popular herbal remedy promoted for the treatment of depression. While there's evidence of its effectiveness, many experts advise against its use, because the amount of active ingredient varies among individual brands and batches, making the effects unpredictable. Taking St John's wort with other medicines, such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants and the combined contraceptive pill , can also cause serious health problems. You shouldn't take St John's wort if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, as it's unclear whether it's safe. Driving and operating machinery. Some antidepressants can cause dizziness, drowsiness and blurred vision, particularly when you first start taking them. If you do experience these problems, you should not drive or use tools and machinery. Cautions for specific antidepressants. SSRIs. SSRIs may not be suitable if you have: bipolar disorder and you're in a manic phase (a period where you're extremely excitable), although they can be useful for depressive phases. a bleeding disorder. type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. epilepsy – SSRIs should only be taken if your epilepsy is well controlled, and the medicine should be stopped if your epilepsy gets worse. kidney disease. SNRIs. SNRIs may not be suitable if you have a history of heart disease or you have poorly controlled high blood pressure (hypertension) . Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). TCAs may not be suitable if you have: a history of heart disease. recently had a heart attack. liver disease. an inherited blood disorder called porphyria. bipolar disorder. schizophrenia. a growth on your adrenal glands that is causing high blood pressure (pheochromocytoma). an enlarged prostate gland (benign prostate enlargement). glaucoma – increased pressure in the eye. epilepsy."
"Dosage - Antidepressants. When prescribing antidepressants, a GP usually selects the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. This approach is intended to reduce the risk of side effects. If this dose does not work, it can be gradually increased. Antidepressants are usually taken in tablet form. Depending on the type of antidepressant prescribed and the severity of your depression, you may have to take 1 to 3 tablets a day. It usually takes around 7 days before you begin to notice the effects of antidepressants. Contact your doctor if you have not noticed any improvement after 4 weeks, as they may recommend increasing your dose or trying a different antidepressant. It's usually recommended that a course of antidepressants continues for at least 6 months after you feel better, to prevent your condition recurring when you stop. Some people with recurrent illness are advised to carry on taking medicine indefinitely. The recommended course of treatment largely depends on weighing up the benefits of the medicine against the side effects. If your illness is severe and the medicine is effective, treatment will often be continued. If your illness is mild and the medicine does not help and causes side effects, continued treatment will not be recommended. Missed or extra doses. It's important not to miss any of your doses, as this could make your treatment less effective. You may also get withdrawal symptoms as a result of missing a dose of the medicine. If you do miss 1 of your doses, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose you missed. If you take more tablets than prescribed, contact your GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible for advice. Stopping antidepressants. Talk to your doctor before you stop taking antidepressants. It's important that you do not stop taking antidepressants suddenly. Once you're ready to come off antidepressants, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks – or longer, if you have been taking them for a long time. This is to help prevent any withdrawal symptoms you might get as a reaction to coming off the medicine. These include: restlessness. trouble sleeping. unsteadiness. sweating. stomach problems. feeling as if there's an electric shock in your head. feeling irritable, anxious or confused. Withdrawal symptoms are often mild and get better on their own. However, some people have withdrawal symptoms that are severe and last for several months or more. Coming off antidepressants too soon can cause your condition to return. Stopping before you have been taking them for 4 weeks may mean the medicine has not had a chance to work."
"Alternatives - Antidepressants. Several treatments can be used instead of antidepressants for treating depression and other mental health conditions. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy that's increasingly being used in the treatment of depression. Most experts recommend that people with moderate to severe depression are treated with a combination of CBT and antidepressants. However, if you're unable or unwilling to take antidepressants, you have the option of receiving CBT on its own. CBT helps you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. It helps you recognise that events in your past may have affected you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It also teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts. CBT is usually available on the NHS, although the waiting lists are usually long. You normally have a short course of sessions, usually 6 to 8 sessions, over 10 to 12 weeks, on a 1-to-1 basis with a therapist trained in CBT. In some cases, you may be offered group CBT. Online CBT. Computerised or online CBT is a form of CBT that works through a computer screen, rather than face-to-face with a therapist. These therapies can be prescribed by your GP or a mental health specialist and are carried out with their advice and support. Ask your GP for more information or read more about self-help therapies . Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with other people and on problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. A course of IPT is usually structured in the same way as a course of CBT. There's some evidence that IPT can be as effective as antidepressants or CBT, but more research is needed. Counselling. Counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you're experiencing in your life to find new ways of dealing with them. Counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems but do not tell you what to do. Counselling on the NHS usually consists of 6 to 12 sessions lasting an hour each. You talk in confidence to a counsellor, who supports you and offers practical advice. Counselling is ideal for people who are generally healthy but need help coping with a current crisis, such as anger, relationship issues, bereavement, redundancy, infertility or the onset of a serious illness. Talking therapies on the NHS. You can get talking therapies like counselling for depression and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Exercise. Research suggests that regular exercise may be a more effective treatment for mild depression than antidepressants. Exercise helps boost levels of chemicals called serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which can lift your mood. Exercising on a regular basis can boost self-esteem and confidence, which can help to relieve symptoms of depression. Read about starting exercise and exercise for depression . Self-help groups. Talking through your feelings can be helpful. You can either talk to a friend or relative, or you can ask your GP to suggest a local self-help group. There are also chat rooms on the internet that offer support.  Lithium. If you've tried several different antidepressants and seen no improvement, your doctor may offer you a medicine called lithium , in addition to your current treatment. If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. So, you'll need blood tests every few months to check your lithium levels while you're taking it. You'll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet. Side effects of lithium include: dry mouth. a metallic taste in your mouth. some mild shaking of your hands. diarrhoea. These side effects usually pass with time once your body gets used to the medicine. Electric shock treatment. Sometimes a treatment called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be recommended if you have severe depression and other treatments have not worked, as it can be highly effective. During ECT, you'll first be given an anaesthetic and medicine to relax your muscles. Then you'll receive an electric current to your brain through electrodes placed on your head. You may be given a series of ECT sessions. It's usually given twice a week for 3 to 6 weeks. It's not exactly clear how ECT works, but recent studies suggest it may help reduce connections in an area of the brain linked to depression. For most people, ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effect tends to wear off after several months. Some people get unpleasant side effects, including short-term headaches, memory problems, nausea and muscle aches. But these risks need to be balanced against the risks of other treatments and the effects of not treating depression."
"Causes - Psychosis. Psychosis can be caused by a mental (psychological) condition, a general medical condition, or alcohol or drug misuse. Psychological causes. The following conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people: schizophrenia – a mental health condition that causes hallucinations and delusions. bipolar disorder – a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of low mood (depression) and highs or elated mood (mania). severe stress or anxiety. severe depression – feelings of persistent sadness, including postnatal depression, which some women experience after having a baby. lack of sleep. The underlying psychological cause often influences the type of psychotic episode someone experiences. For example, a person with bipolar disorder is more likely to have grandiose delusions. Someone with depression or schizophrenia is more likely to develop persecutory delusions. See symptoms of psychosis for more information on delusions. General medical conditions. The following medical conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people: HIV and AIDS. malaria. syphilis. Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease. hypoglycaemia (an abnormally low level of glucose in the blood). lupus. multiple sclerosis. brain tumour. sudden illness or injury, such as a high temperature or a head injury. Substances. Alcohol misuse and drug misuse can trigger a psychotic episode. A person can also experience a psychotic episode if they suddenly stop drinking alcohol or taking drugs after using them for a long time. This is known as withdrawal. It's also possible to experience psychosis after drinking large amounts of alcohol or if you're high on drugs. Drugs known to trigger psychotic episodes include: cocaine. amphetamine (speed). methamphetamine (crystal meth). mephedrone (MCAT or miaow). MDMA (ecstasy). cannabis. LSD (acid). psilocybins (magic mushrooms). ketamine. Medicine. In rare situations, psychosis can also occur as a side effect of some types of medicine or as a result of an overdose of that medicine. Never stop taking a prescribed medicine unless advised to do so by a GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. See a GP if you're experiencing psychotic side effects caused by medicine. The brain. There's been a great deal of research into how psychosis affects the brain and how changes in the brain can trigger symptoms of psychosis . It’s thought psychosis may be linked to increased activity of neurotransmitters in the brain. Neurotransmitters, like dopamine, are chemicals that help send information inside the brain. Evidence for the role of dopamine in psychosis comes from the fact medicines known to reduce the effects of dopamine in the brain also reduce the symptoms of psychosis."
"Diagnosis - Psychosis. You should visit a GP if you're experiencing symptoms of psychosis. It's important to speak to a GP as soon as possible because earlier treatment can be more effective. Initial assessment. There's no test to positively diagnose psychosis. However, your GP will ask about your symptoms and possible causes. For example, they may ask you: whether you're taking any medicines. about your use of alcohol or drugs. how your moods have been – for example, whether you've been depressed. how you've been functioning day-to-day – for example, whether you're still working. whether you have a family history of mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia. about the details of your hallucinations, such as whether you've heard voices. about the details of your delusions, such as whether you feel people are controlling you. whether you've harmed yourself or thought about harming yourself. about any other symptoms you have. Referral. The evidence supporting the early treatment of psychosis means you're likely to be referred to a specialist urgently. Who you're referred to will depend on your symptoms and the services available in your area. You may be referred to: a community mental health team – a team of mental health professionals who provide support to people with complex mental health conditions. a crisis resolution team – a team of mental health professionals who treat people who would otherwise require treatment in hospital. an early intervention team – a team of mental health professionals who work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis. These teams are likely to include some or all of the following: a psychiatrist – a qualified medical doctor who has received further training in treating mental health conditions. a community mental health nurse – a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions. a psychologist – a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions. a social worker - who can provide practical help and support with issues such as housing and finances. Your psychiatrist will carry out a full assessment to help identify and diagnose any underlying mental health condition that could be causing your symptoms. This will help when planning your treatment for psychosis . Helping others. The lack of insight and level of distress associated with psychosis means people experiencing it are not always able to recognise their symptoms. They may be reluctant to visit a GP if they believe there's nothing wrong with them. You may need to help them get support and treatment. Someone who has had psychotic episodes in the past may have been assigned a a home treatment or crisis resolution team (CRT). You can try to contact that team If they have not been assigned a team or you do not have their contact details , call 111 or go to 111.nhs.uk for advice. If you think the person poses an immediate threat of danger to themselves or others, call 999 and ask for advice. If someone has very severe psychosis, they can be compulsorily detained at hospital for assessment and treatment under the Mental Health Act (1983). The mental health charity Mind has more information about the Mental Health Act (1983) . Mental Health Act. The Mental Health Act is the main piece of legislation that covers the assessment, treatment and rights of people with a mental health condition. Under the Act, a person can only be compulsorily admitted to hospital or another mental health facility (sometimes called “sectioned"") if they: have a mental disorder of a nature or degree that makes admission to hospital appropriate. need to be admitted in the interests of their own safety, for the protection of others, or both. Depending on the nature of the mental health disorder and the individual's circumstances, the length of time a person can be sectioned is : 72 hours. 28 days. 6 months. Before these time periods have elapsed, an assessment will be carried out to determine whether it's safe for the person to be discharged or further treatment is required. Any person compulsorily admitted has the right to appeal against the decision to a Mental Health Tribunal (MHT). This is an independent body that decides whether a patient should be discharged from hospital Driving. Do not drive during an episode of psychosis. It's your legal obligation to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about any medical condition that could affect your driving ability, including psychosis. GOV.UK provides details about telling the DVLA about a medical condition ."
"Treatment - Psychosis. Treatment for psychosis involves a combination of antipsychotic medicines, talking therapies and social support. Your care team. Your treatment is likely to involve a team of mental health professionals working together. If this is your first psychotic episode, you may be referred to an early intervention team. Early intervention teams. An early intervention team is a team of healthcare professionals set up specifically to work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis. Depending on your care needs, early intervention teams aim to provide: a full assessment of your needs. medicine. talking therapies. social, occupational and educational interventions. Treatment for psychosis will vary, depending on the underlying cause. You'll receive specific treatment if you've been diagnosed with an underlying mental health condition as well. Antipsychotics. Antipsychotic medicines are usually recommended as the first treatment for psychosis. They work by blocking the effect of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, which are chemicals that transmit messages in the brain. However, they're not suitable or effective for everyone, as side effects can affect people differently. In particular, antipsychotics will be monitored closely in people who also have epilepsy , a condition that causes seizures or fits. People who have cardiovascular disease – conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, or circulation, such as heart disease – will also be closely monitored. Antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety within a few hours of use, but they may take several days or weeks to reduce psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts. Antipsychotics can be taken by mouth (orally) or given as an injection. There are several slow-release antipsychotics, where you only need an injection every 1 to 4 weeks. Side effects. Antipsychotics can have side effects, although not everyone will experience them and their severity will differ from person to person. Side effects can include: drowsiness. shaking and trembling. weight gain. restlessness. muscle twitches and spasms – where your muscles shorten tightly and painfully. blurred vision. dizziness. constipation. loss of sex drive (libido). dry mouth. Tell a GP or mental health worker if you have side effects that are becoming particularly troublesome. There may be an alternative antipsychotic medicine you can take that causes less side effects. Rarely, antipsychotics can trigger suicidal feelings or an urge to self-harm. Call 999 or go to A&E now if you have thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself. Never stop taking medicine prescribed for you unless advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. Suddenly stopping prescription medicine could trigger a return of your symptoms (relapse). When it's time for you to stop taking your medicine, it will be done gradually. Talking therapies. Talking therapies can help reduce the intensity and anxiety caused by psychosis. There are several possible talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis is based on an understanding of how people make sense of their experiences and why some people become distressed by them. A CBT therapist may encourage you to consider different ways of understanding what's happening to you. The aim is to help you achieve goals that are meaningful and important to you, such as reducing your distress, returning to work, education or training, or regaining a sense of control. Family intervention. Family intervention is known to be an effective form of therapy for people with psychosis. It's a way of helping both you and your family cope with your condition. After having an episode of psychosis, you may rely on your family members for care and support. While most family members are happy to help, the stress of caring for somebody can place a strain on any family. Family therapy involves a series of meetings that take place over a period of 3 months or more. Meetings may include: discussing your condition and how it might progress, plus the available treatments. exploring ways of supporting someone with psychosis. deciding how to solve practical problems caused by psychosis, such as planning how to manage future psychotic episodes. Self-help groups. If you're experiencing episodes of psychosis, you may benefit from being around other people who've had similar experiences. For example, the mental health charity Mind has more than 150 local Mind networks , which may be able to put you in touch with a support group in your area, as well as provide a range of other useful services. Rehabilitation for psychosis. If your treatment for psychosis is not working, you might be offered rehabilitation. The aim of rehabilitation is to build your confidence and skills so you can cope with your condition and become as independent as possible. You'll be offered different types of support as your needs change, and you can go through the rehabilitation process more than once if you need to. Your rehabilitation team will include people from different parts of the health and care system, such as a rehabilitation psychiatrist, mental health nurse, occupational therapist and social worker. Depending on your needs, you might also see other people who can help, such as a dietitian or exercise coach. Rehabilitation should happen close to where you live, but sometimes the services you need might be outside your local area. Your team will work with you to decide on the types of care you need for your physical and mental health, which is called your care plan. They'll also help you set goals you want to achieve, such as managing in your own cooking and shopping, or going back to work. Mental Health Act. If you're experiencing a particularly severe psychotic episode and your care team think you would be best cared for in a hospital or clinic, they will explain this to you and encourage you to admit yourself for care. If you refuse to go to hospital and it's felt you present a significant danger to yourself or others, you can be compulsorily admitted to a hospital (detained) under the Mental Health Act . You’ll be kept in hospital only for as long as needed, so you can have appropriate treatment. If you're detained under the Act, every effort will be made to obtain your consent to treatment . Healthcare professionals will explain to you any treatment you need. You may be treated without consent (against your will). However, you cannot be treated for any physical condition if you do not consent to treatment, unless the physical condition is linked to your mental health condition. The mental health charity Mind has more information about the Mental Health Act (1983) . Violence and aggression. Acts of violence and aggression are fairly uncommon in people with psychosis. They're more likely to be victims of violence than those being violent. However, there may be times when your behaviour places yourself or others at risk of harm. Mental health staff have been trained to deal with aggressive behaviour. They will try to help reduce any distress, agitation and aggression, but it may be necessary to hold you down without hurting you. This is known as physical restraint. You may then be moved to a secluded room. In some cases, you may need to be given medicine that will quickly make you very relaxed. You'll be offered the medicine voluntarily, in the form of tablets, but you can be treated against your consent if you refuse. This may involve giving you an injection of a tranquilliser (rapid tranquillisation). It's important to stress that these methods are only used in extreme circumstances and are not routinely used to treat psychosis. Advance decisions to refuse treatment. If you're at risk of having psychotic episodes in the future and there are certain treatments you do not want to have, it's possible to pre-arrange a legally binding advance decision , previously known as an advance directive. An advance decision is a written statement about what you'd like health professionals and your family or friends to do if you experience another psychotic episode. You may also want to include the contact details of your care team. To create an advance decision, you need to make your wishes clear, in writing, and ask a witness to sign it. You should include specific details about any treatments you do not want and specific circumstances in which they may apply. However, an advance decision can be overruled if a person is subsequently detained under the Mental Health Act. Although doctors will try to take your wishes into account when deciding on treatment, they may decide it's in your best interests not to follow the advance decision. Find out about advance decisions on the MIND website . Yellow Card Scheme. The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report the suspected side effects of any medicine you're taking. It's run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) ."
"Treatment - Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is usually treated with an individually tailored combination of talking therapy and medicine. Most people with schizophrenia are treated by community mental health teams (CMHTs). The goal of the CMHT is to provide day-to-day support and treatment while ensuring you have as much independence as possible. A CMHT can be made up of and provide access to: social workers. community mental health nurses – who have specialist training in mental health conditions. occupational therapists. pharmacists. counsellors and psychotherapists. psychologists and psychiatrists – the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the team. During your first episode of schizophrenia, you should initially be referred to an early intervention team. These specialist teams provide treatment and support, and are usually made up of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, social workers and support workers. Depending on your needs, you may be in regular contact with just 1 or 2 members of the team or you may need help from the entire CMHT. Care programme approach (CPA). People with complex mental health conditions are usually entered into a treatment process known as a care programme approach (CPA). A CPA is essentially a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. There are 4 stages to a CPA: assessment – your health and social needs are assessed. care plan – a care plan is created to meet your health and social needs. key worker appointed – a key worker, usually a social worker or nurse, is your first point of contact with other members of the CMHT. reviews – your treatment will be regularly reviewed and, if needed, changes to the care plan can be agreed. You'll work together with your healthcare team to develop a care plan. The care plan may involve an advance statement or crisis plan, which can be followed in an emergency. Your care plan should include a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme and support for giving up smoking, if you smoke. Your care co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure all members of your healthcare team, including your GP, have a copy of your care plan. Further information Rethink Mental Illness: Care programme approach. Managing acute episodes. People with schizophrenia can experience what is known as an acute schizophrenic episode. During an acute episode the symptoms of psychosis, where a person is unable to tell the difference between reality and their imagination, can become overwhelming. During this time, a person may require a more intensive level of care than a CMHT can provide, to help keep them safe from harm. Crisis resolution teams (CRT). A treatment option is to contact a home treatment or crisis resolution team (CRT). CRTs care for people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric episode, sometimes called a 'crisis'. The aim of a CRT is to support people without having to admit them to a hospital (but they can arrange admission if needed). The CRT aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. This can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre. CRTs are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis occurring. Your care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis. Treatment in a hospital or clinic. People who are undergoing a very severe schizophrenia episode may require in-patient care at a hospital or psychiatric clinic. If a person’s care team think they would be best cared for in a hospital or clinic, they will explain that to the person and encourage them to admit themselves for care. There may be times when a person refuses to go into hospital but the clinic feels that they do not have the mental capacity to make an informed decision about their own care.  In situations like this the Mental Health Act (2007) does legally allow a person to be compulsorily detained at a hospital or clinic. It must be thought that detention is necessary to protect: that person’s health and safety. the health and safety of others. Sometimes the wards need to be locked for the safety of the people being cared for. All people being treated in hospital will stay only as long as is absolutely necessary for them to receive appropriate treatment and arrange aftercare. An independent panel will regularly review your case and progress. Once they feel you're no longer a danger to yourself and others, you'll be discharged from hospital. However, your care team may recommend you remain in hospital voluntarily. More serious acute schizophrenic episodes may need to be cared for in a psychiatric ward at a hospital or clinic. If the care team think a person would be best cared for on a ward, they will talk to the person and encourage them to admit themselves voluntarily to hospital. Rarely, if a person's care team feels they are not able to make the decision for themselves they may need to be admitted under the Mental Health Act (2007). This is sometimes called 'compulsorily admission'. It's only possible for someone to be compulsorily admitted to a hospital if they have a severe mental health condition and it's in the best interests of: the person's own health and safety. the health and safety of others. All people being treated in hospital will stay only as long as is absolutely necessary for them to receive appropriate treatment and arrange aftercare. An independent panel will regularly review the person's progress. Once they feel the level of risk has lowered, the person can be discharged from hospital. However, the care team may recommend they stay in hospital voluntarily. Advance statements. If it's felt there's a significant risk of future acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, you may want to write an advance statement. An advance statement is a series of written instructions about what you would like your family or friends to do in case you experience another acute schizophrenic episode. You may also want to include contact details for your care co-ordinator. An advanced statement can also give instructions on how you want to be cared for if you're not in a position to make decisions about treatment yourself. These instructions can include your wishes regarding your treatment and who you would like to be contacted, such as a family member or a friend, in the event of a crisis. Advanced statements are not legally binding, so health professionals will always act in your best interest when required, but they will follow your wishes whenever possible. If you want to make an advance statement, talk to your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP. Further information:. Mind: Health and social care rights. Antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are usually recommended as the initial treatment for the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic episode. They work by blocking the effect of the chemical dopamine, or other chemicals on the brain. Antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but may take several days or weeks to reduce other symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts. Your doctor may recommend a physical examination, and possibly some scans, such as an ECG. It's important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you. Antipsychotics can be taken orally as a pill, or be given as an injection known as a depot. Several slow-release antipsychotics are available. These require you to have one injection every 1 to 4 weeks. You will usually be given the lowest dose possible that it thought able to effectively control symptoms. You may only need antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed. However, most people take medication for 1 or 2 years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent. There are 2 main types of antipsychotics: typical antipsychotics – the first generation of antipsychotics developed in the 1950 s. atypical antipsychotics – newer-generation antipsychotics developed in the 1990 s. The choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects. Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person. The side effects of typical antipsychotics include: shaking. trembling. muscle twitches. muscle spasms. Side effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include: drowsiness. weight gain, particularly with some atypical antipsychotics. lack of sex drive. blurred vision. constipation. dry mouth. Antipsychotics can also cause side effects which may need to be monitored while you are taking them. These include: an increase in your blood cholesterol levels. changes in your blood sugar levels. your blood pressure can become both higher or lower than usual. Tell your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP if your side effects become severe. There may be an alternative antipsychotic you can take or additional medicines that will help you deal with the side effects. If you do not benefit from your antipsychotic medicine after taking it regularly for several weeks, an alternative can be tried. It's important to work with your treatment team to find the right medicine for you. Do not stop taking your antipsychotics without first consulting your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP. If you stop taking them, you could have a relapse of symptoms. Your medicine and any side effects will be closely monitored for the first few months. After this your medicine should be reviewed at least once a year. Further information Mind: Antipsychotics. Royal College of Psychiatrists: Depot medication. Talking therapies. Talking therapies can help people with schizophrenia cope with the symptoms of hallucinations or delusions better. They can also help treat some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy or a lack of enjoyment and interest in things you used to enjoy. Talking therapies for schizophrenia work best when they're combined with antipsychotic medication. Common talking therapies for schizophrenia include: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). family therapy. arts therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you identify the thinking patterns that are causing you to have unwanted feelings and behaviour, and learn to change this thinking with more realistic and useful thoughts. For example, you may be taught to recognise examples of delusional thinking. You may then receive help and advice about how to avoid acting on these thoughts. Most people require a series of CBT sessions over the course of a number of months. CBT sessions usually last for about an hour. Your GP or care co-ordinator should be able to arrange a referral to a CBT therapist. Family therapy. Family therapy aims to support the person with schizophrenia and the people they live with or are close to, such as partners or family members. It can help everybody that may be affected by schizophrenia, not just the individual living with the condition. It usually involves informal sessions over the course of 6 months. Family therapy sessions may include: discussing information about schizophrenia. exploring ways of supporting somebody with schizophrenia. deciding how to solve practical problems that can be caused by the symptoms of schizophrenia. planning what to do in a crisis situation. If you think you and your family could benefit from family therapy, speak to your care co-ordinator or GP. Arts therapy. Arts therapies are designed to promote creative expression. Working with an arts therapist in a small group or individually can allow you to express your experiences with schizophrenia. Some people find expressing things in a non-verbal way through the arts can provide a new experience of schizophrenia and help them develop new ways of relating to others. Arts therapies have been shown to alleviate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in some people. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that arts therapies are provided by an arts therapist registered with the Health and Care Professions Council who has experience of working with people with schizophrenia.

"Living with - Schizophrenia. Most people with schizophrenia make a recovery, although many will experience the occasional return of symptoms (relapses). Support and treatment can help you to manage your condition and the impact it has on your life. Caring for your own health can also make treating your condition easier and help reduce anxiety, depression and fatigue. It can help you have a better quality of life and be more active and independent. Self care includes: maintaining good physical and mental health. preventing illness or accidents. effectively dealing with minor ailments and long-term conditions. As part of the care programme approach, you'll be in contact with your healthcare team regularly. Having a good relationship with the team means you can easily discuss your symptoms or concerns. The more they know, the more they can help you. Spotting the signs of an acute schizophrenic episode. Learning to recognise the signs that you're becoming unwell can help you manage your illness. Signs can include losing your appetite, feeling anxious or stressed, or having disturbed sleep. You may also notice some milder symptoms developing, such as: feeling suspicious or fearful. worrying about people's motives. hearing quiet voices now and again. finding it difficult to concentrate. You may also want to ask someone you trust to tell you if they notice your behaviour changing. Recognising the initial signs of an acute schizophrenic episode can be useful, as it may be prevented through the use of antipsychotic medicines and extra support. If you have another acute episode of schizophrenia, your written care plan should be followed, particularly any advance statement or crisis plan. Your care plan will include the likely signs of a developing relapse and the steps to take, including emergency contact numbers. Read about treating schizophrenia for information about advance statements. Taking your medicine. It's important to take your medicine as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. Continuous medicine can help prevent relapses. If you have questions or concerns about medicine you're taking or any side effects, talk to your GP or care co-ordinator. It may also be useful to read the information leaflet that comes with the medicine about possible interactions with other drugs or supplements. It's worth checking with your healthcare team if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies, such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements, as these can sometimes interfere with your medicine. Healthy living. Keep healthy. As well as monitoring your mental health, your healthcare team and GP should monitor your physical health. A healthy lifestyle, including having a balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables and taking regular exercise, is good for you and can reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes . You should also try to avoid too much stress and have a regular sleep pattern. You should have a check-up with a GP at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure, and having any appropriate blood tests. Stop smoking. Stopping smoking has been shown to improve the mental health of people with schizophrenia. It also reduces your risk of cancer, heart disease and stroke. Find out how stopping smoking can improve your mental health. You can ask your GP about NHS support, as well as stop smoking medicines such as patches, gum or inhalers. You can also go to NHS Quit smoking to find out more. If you take antipsychotic medicines and want to stop smoking, or you start smoking again if you stopped, it's very important to talk to your GP or psychiatrist. The dosage of your prescription drugs may need to be monitored and the amount you have to take could be reduced depending on if you smoke. Avoiding drugs and alcohol. Regularly drinking more than the recommended amount of alcohol or using illegal drugs can trigger psychosis and make symptoms of schizophrenia worse. Alcohol and drug use can also cause other mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety as well as causing damage to your physical health. Drugs and alcohol can also react badly with antipsychotic medicines. If you're currently using drugs or alcohol and finding it hard to stop, ask your care co-ordinator or GP for help. Further information. Rethink Mental Illness: wellbeing and physical health. Who is available to help me? In the course of your treatment for schizophrenia, you'll be involved with many different services. Some are accessed through referral from a GP, others through the local authority. These services may include: community mental health teams (CMHTs) – these provide the main part of local specialist mental health services, and offer assessment, treatment and social care to people living with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. trained peer support – this involves the support of someone who has had schizophrenia themselves and is now stable, and may be available through your CMHT. early intervention teams – these provide early identification and treatment for people with the first symptoms of psychosis; your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team. crisis services – specialist mental health teams that help with crises that occur outside normal office hours and allow people to be treated at home for an acute episode of illness instead of in hospital. acute day hospitals – an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital, where you can visit every day or as often as necessary. advocates – trained and experienced workers who help people communicate their needs or wishes, get impartial information, and represent their views to other people; they can be based in your hospital or mental health support groups, or you can find an independent advocate to act on your behalf.

If you're employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way. Under the Equality Act 2010 , all employers must make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities, including people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Several organisations provide support, training and advice for people with schizophrenia who wish to continue working. Your community mental health team is a good first point of contact to find out what services and support are available for you. Mental health charities such as Mind or Rethink Mental Illness are also excellent sources of information on training and employment. If you're unable to work as a result of your mental illness, you're entitled to financial support, such as Incapacity Benefit. Further information. GOV.UK: Disability and the Equality Act 2010. GOV.UK: Incapacity Benefit. Money Advice Service. Rethink Mental Illness: Money, benefits and employment. Talk to others. Many people find it helpful to meet other people with the same experiences for mutual support and to share ideas. It's also an important reminder that you're not alone. Charities and support groups allow individuals and families to share experiences and coping strategies, campaign for better services, and provide support. Useful charities, support groups and associations include: Hearing Voices Network. Mind. Rethink Mental Illness. SANE. There are also other places that offer support to people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Day centres. Even if you do not have a job or are unable to work, it's still important to go out and do everyday things and give a structure to your week. Many people regularly go to a day hospital, day centre or community mental health centre. These offer a range of activities that allow you to get active again and spend some time in the company of other people. Work projects. These provide training to help you develop your work skills and support you back into work. They often have contacts with local employers. Supported accommodation. This could be a bedsit or flat where there's someone around who is trained to support you and help you deal with day-to-day problems. Peer support. You may be offered the chance to meet regularly with a trained peer support worker who has recovered from psychosis or schizophrenia themselves. Further information. Mind: Housing and mental health. What can family, friends and partners do to help? Friends, relatives and partners have a vital role in helping people with schizophrenia recover, and make a relapse less likely. Do not blame the person with schizophrenia or tell them to ""pull themselves together"", or blame other people. Instead you could try to offer them support and understanding about how they are feeling. It's important to stay positive and supportive when dealing with a friend or loved one's mental illness. As well as supporting the person with schizophrenia, you may want to get support to cope with your own feelings. Several voluntary organisations provide help and support for carers. The care team may be able to provide you with an assessment about your own needs, which you can share with your GP if needed. The care team can also offer you information to help you understand what schizophrenia is, how it affects people, and how you can help. You should have a discussion with the care team about what to do in the event of a crisis. As part of someone's treatment, you may be offered family therapy. This can provide information and support for the person with schizophrenia and their family. Friends and family can play a major role by monitoring the person's mental state, watching out for any signs of relapse, and encouraging them to take their medication and attend medical appointments. If you're the nearest relative of a person who has schizophrenia, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the patient's interests. These include requesting that the local social services authority ask an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with schizophrenia should be detained in hospital. Additional help, including financial support, may also be available for you if you are caring for a family member, friend or partner with schizophrenia. Further information. Mind: Supporting yourself while caring for someone. Depression and suicide. People with schizophrenia have increased risk of suicide then the general population. The risk may be higher after an acute episode or hospital stay. This and other stresses, such as financial worries or feeling isolated, can lead to symptoms of depression. Signs you may be depressed include feeling particularly down over the last month and no longer taking pleasure in the things you used to enjoy. Do not ignore these symptoms. If depression is not treated, it can worsen and lead to suicidal thoughts. If you have symptoms or depression, or any suicidal thoughts, it's very important that you immediately tell your GP or care-coordinator. You can also call the Samaritans on 116 123 at any time of the day or night. The warning signs of suicide. The warning signs that people with depression and schizophrenia may be considering suicide include: making final arrangements – such as giving away possessions, making a will or saying goodbye to friends. talking about death or suicide – this may be a direct statement such as, ""I wish I was dead"", or indirect phrases such as, ""I think that dead people must be happier than us"", or ""Wouldn't it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up?"". self-harm – such as cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes. a sudden lifting of mood – this could mean a person has decided to try to end their life (suicide) and feels better because of their decision. Helping a suicidal friend or relative. If you see any of these warning signs: get professional help for the person, such as from a crisis resolution team or the duty psychiatrist at your local A&E department. let them know they're not alone and you care about them. offer your support in finding other solutions to their problems. If you feel there's an immediate danger of the person attempting to end their life (suicide), stay with them or have someone else stay with them. Remove all available means of suicide, such as sharp objects and medication. Further information. Help for suicidal thoughts. Samaritans."
"Why people self-harm. Self-harm is when somebody intentionally damages or injures their body. Some of the reasons that people may self-harm include: expressing or coping with emotional distress. trying to feel in control. a way of punishing themselves. relieving unbearable emotional distress. a cry for help. a response to intrusive thoughts. Self-harm may be linked to bad experiences that are happening now, or in the past. But sometimes the reason is unknown. The reasons can also change over time and will not be the same for everybody. Common causes of emotional distress. Self-harm is most often described as a way to express or cope with emotional distress. There are many possible causes of emotional distress. It's often a build-up of many smaller things that leads people to think about self-harm. Some examples include: being bullied. pressure at school or work. family arguments or relationship problems. money worries. low self-esteem. struggling with stress, anxiety or depression. confusion about sexuality. grief after bereavement or loss. physical or sexual abuse. being in contact with the criminal justice system. experiencing complex mental health difficulties that sometimes cause impulsive behaviour or difficulty controlling emotions, often due to past trauma. living with conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism. Self-harm and suicide. There is evidence of a clear link between suicide or suicidal thoughts and people who have previously self-harmed. However, not everyone who self-harms wants to end their life. Some people describe their self-harm as a way of staying alive by responding to or coping with severe emotional distress. It's important to find the right support or treatment to help deal with the underlying cause in a less harmful way. Information: Further information and support. Mind – Why people self-harm."
"Ways to help avoid self-harm. Finding ways to prevent or distract yourself from self-harm may help you get through a difficult moment. However, it's very important that you get the support and treatment that you need to help address the underlying cause. It can feel like a big step to speak to someone you do not know about your feelings or experiences. But with support it may feel easier to make changes that help reduce or stop your self-harm. Ways to help avoid self-harm. Do. try talking about your feelings to a friend, family member, trained volunteer or health professional. You could contact Samaritans, call: 116 123 or email: jo@samaritans.org if you need someone to talk to. try working out if feeling a certain way leads to your self-harm – for example, when you're feeling sad or anxious you could try expressing that emotion in a safer way. try waiting before you consider self-harm – distract yourself by going out for a walk, listening to music, or doing something else harmless to keep you busy; the need to self-harm may begin to pass over time. try calming breathing exercises or other things you find relaxing to reduce feelings of anxiety. write down your feelings – no one else needs to see it. read about mental health and wellbeing – including help for common feelings such as stress, anxiety and depression. if you struggle with suicidal thoughts, it may help to make a safety plan to use if you need it – the Staying Safe website has a guide on how to make a safety plan.

"How to tell someone about self-harm. It can be difficult to know how to talk to your friends, family or a health professional about self-harm. But many people feel more supported and less alone after talking to someone. Tips to help you tell someone about self-harm. Do. find someone you can trust – such as a close friend, family member, trained volunteer or health professional. decide on the right time or place to talk to someone – it may feel easier to write something down, talk online or call and practise what you want to say first. let the person know that what you're sharing may be a shock to them, but you're looking for help – ask to continue the conversation another time if the other person feels distressed or you're interrupted. try to talk honestly and openly – be clear about how you're feeling, why you're asking for help and things they may be able to do. let the other person ask questions – but do not feel you have to answer them all right now. decide if you want to show the other person any injuries or scars – if you're talking to a health professional they may want to check if you need treatment.

"How to help someone else. If you think someone you know has started to self-harm, it's important to approach the subject with care and understanding. It can be very helpful to just be there and let them know they're not alone. But it's important to remember you may not be able to help them on your own. How to recognise self-harm. It can be hard to recognise when someone has started to self-harm as they may not want anyone else to know. There are also many different ways that someone might self-harm. Physical signs of self-harm keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather. unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on the wrists, arms, thighs and chest. unexplained blood stains on clothing or tissues. signs that they have been pulling out their hair. Emotional signs of self-harm becoming very withdrawn and not speaking to others. signs of depression, such as low mood, tearfulness or a lack of motivation or interest in anything. signs of low self-esteem, such as thinking they're not good enough. talking about ending things or not wanting to go on. Things you can try to help. There are some things you can try that may help someone feel more supported and able to get help. Do. encourage them to speak to a GP or free listening service about self-harm. ask how they would like to be supported. let them know you're there for them. tell them about their positive qualities. try to understand their emotions and experiences, without judging them, rather than focusing on their self-harm. consider that any amount of self-harm might be a sign that they're feeling extremely distressed. let them be in control of their decisions, but get them medical attention if needed. Don’t. do not try to force them to change what they're doing. do not threaten to take away their control. do not insult them, for example by saying they're attention-seeking. Information: Further information and support. If you're supporting someone who self-harms you should also make sure you take care of yourself.

"Symptoms - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) affects people differently, but usually causes a particular pattern of thoughts and behaviours. OCD has 3 main elements: obsessions – where an unwanted, intrusive and often distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters your mind. emotions – the obsession causes a feeling of intense anxiety or distress. compulsions – repetitive behaviours or mental acts that a person with OCD feels driven to perform as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession. The compulsive behaviour temporarily relieves the anxiety, but the obsession and anxiety soon return, causing the cycle to begin again. Most people with OCD experience both obsessive thoughts and compulsions, but one may be less obvious than the other. Obsessive thoughts. Almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point, such as thinking they may have forgotten to lock the door of the house, or even sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images. But if you have a persistent, unpleasant thought that dominates your thinking to the extent it interrupts other thoughts, you may have an obsession. Some common obsessions that affect people with OCD include: fear of deliberately harming yourself or others – for example, fear you may attack someone else, such as your children. fear of harming yourself or others by mistake – for example, fear you may set the house on fire by leaving the cooker on. fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance. a need for symmetry or orderliness – for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the labels on the tins in your cupboard face the same way. You may have obsessive thoughts of a violent or sexual nature that you find repulsive or frightening. But they're just thoughts and having them does not mean you'll act on them. These thoughts are classed as OCD if they cause you distress or have an impact on the quality of your life. Compulsive behaviour. Compulsions start as a way of trying to reduce or prevent anxiety caused by the obsessive thought, although in reality, this behaviour is either excessive or not realistically connected. For example, a person who fears contamination with germs may wash their hands repeatedly, or someone with a fear of harming their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to ""neutralise"" the thought. Most people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational and makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on it and feel they need to do it ""just in case"". Common types of compulsive behaviour in people with OCD include: cleaning and hand washing. checking – such as checking doors are locked or that the gas is off. counting. ordering and arranging. hoarding. asking for reassurance. repeating words in their head. thinking ""neutralising"" thoughts to counter the obsessive thoughts. avoiding places and situations that could trigger obsessive thoughts. Not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people. Getting help. It's important to get help if you think you have OCD and it's having a significant impact on your life. If you think a friend or family member may have OCD, try talking to them about your concerns and suggest they get help. OCD is unlikely to get better on its own, but treatment and support is available to help you manage your symptoms and have a better quality of life. There are 2 main ways to get help: refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service – find an NHS talking therapies service in your area. see a GP – they can either prescribe suitable medicine or refer you to a local talking therapies service if necessary. Contact a GP or care team immediately if you ever feel you cannot go on. You can also: call 116 123 to talk to the Samaritans, or email: jo@samaritans.org for a reply within 24 hours. contact NHS 111.  Related problems. Some people with OCD may also have or develop other serious mental health problems, including: depression – a condition that typically causes lasting feelings of sadness and hopelessness, or a loss of interest in the things you used to enjoy. eating disorders – conditions characterised by an abnormal attitude towards food that cause you to change your eating habits and behaviour. generalised anxiety disorder – a condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event. a hoarding disorder – a condition that involves excessively acquiring items and not being able to throw them away, resulting in unmanageable amounts of clutter. People with OCD and severe depression may also have suicidal feelings ."
"Hoarding disorder. A hoarding disorder is where someone acquires an excessive number of items and stores them in a chaotic manner, usually resulting in unmanageable amounts of clutter. The items can be of little or no monetary value. Hoarding is considered a significant problem if: the amount of clutter interferes with everyday living – for example, the person is unable to use their kitchen or bathroom and cannot access rooms. the clutter is causing significant distress or negatively affecting the quality of life of the person or their family – for example, they become upset if someone tries to clear the clutter and their relationship suffers. Hoarding disorders are challenging to treat because many people who hoard frequently do not see it as a problem, or have little awareness of how it's affecting their life or the lives of others. Some may realise they have a problem but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it. It's really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their difficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems but also pose a health and safety risk. If not tackled, it's a problem that will probably never go away. Why someone may hoard. The reasons why someone begins hoarding are not fully understood. It can be a symptom of another condition. For example, someone with mobility problems may be physically unable to clear the huge amounts of clutter they have acquired, and people with learning disabilities or people developing dementia may be unable to categorise and dispose of items. Mental health problems associated with hoarding include: severe depression. psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect. These people are more likely to: live alone. be unmarried. have had a deprived childhood, with either a lack of material objects or a poor relationship with other members of their family. have a family history of hoarding. have grown up in a cluttered home and never learned to prioritise and sort items. Many people who hoard have strongly held beliefs related to acquiring and discarding things, such as: ""I may need this someday"" or ""If I buy this, it will make me happy"". Others may be struggling to cope with a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one. Attempts to discard things often bring up very strong emotions that can feel overwhelming, so the person hoarding often tends to put off or avoid making decisions about what can be thrown out. Often, many of the things kept are of little or no monetary value and may be what most people would consider rubbish. The person may keep the items for reasons that are not obvious to other people, such as for sentimental reasons, or feeling the objects appear beautiful or useful. Most people with a hoarding disorder have a very strong emotional attachment to the objects. What's the difference between hoarding and collecting? Many people collect items such as books or stamps, and this is not considered a problem. The difference between a ""hoard"" and a ""collection"" is how these items are organised. A collection is usually well ordered, and the items are easily accessible. A hoard is usually very disorganised, takes up a lot of room and the items are largely inaccessible. For example, someone who collects newspaper reviews may cut out the reviews they want and organise them in a catalogue or scrapbook. Someone who hoards may keep large stacks of newspapers that clutter their entire house and mean it's not actually possible to read any of the reviews they wanted to keep. Signs of a hoarding disorder. Someone who has a hoarding disorder may typically: keep or collect items that may have little or no monetary value, such as junk mail and carrier bags, or items they intend to reuse or repair. find it hard to categorise or organise items. have difficulty making decisions. struggle to manage everyday tasks, such as cooking, cleaning and paying bills. become extremely attached to items, refusing to let anyone touch or borrow them. have poor relationships with family or friends. Hoarding can start as early as the teenage years and gets more noticeable with age. For many, hoarding becomes more problematic in older age, but the problem is usually well established by this time. Items people may hoard. Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects. Items that are often hoarded include: newspapers and magazines. books. clothes. leaflets and letters, including junk mail. bills and receipts. containers, including plastic bags and cardboard boxes. household supplies. Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly. More recently, hoarding of data has become more common. This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that they're extremely reluctant to delete. Why hoarding disorders are a problem. A hoarding disorder can be a problem for several reasons. It can take over the person's life, making it very difficult for them to get around their house. It can cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer. The person hoarding is usually reluctant or unable to have visitors or even allow tradesmen in to carry out essential repairs, which can cause isolation and loneliness. The clutter can pose a health risk to the person and anyone who lives in or visits their house. For example, it can: make cleaning very difficult, leading to unhygienic conditions and encouraging rodent or insect infestations. be a fire risk and block exits in the event of a fire. cause trips and falls. fall over or collapse on people, if kept in large piles. The hoarding could also be a sign of an underlying condition, such as OCD , other types of anxiety , depression and dementia . What you can do if you suspect someone is hoarding. If you think a family member or someone you know has a hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to come with you to see a GP. This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help. Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing. Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out. You're just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering. Your GP may be able to refer you to your local community mental health team, which might have a therapist who's familiar with issues such as OCD and hoarding. If you have difficulties accessing therapy, the charity OCD-UK may be able to help. It's generally not a good idea to get extra storage space or call in the council or environmental health to clear the rubbish away. This won't solve the problem and the clutter often quickly builds up again. How hoarding disorders are treated. It's not easy to treat a hoarding disorder, even when the person is prepared to seek help, but it can be overcome. The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . The therapist will help the person to understand what makes it difficult to throw things away and the reasons why the clutter has built up. This will be combined with practical tasks and a plan to work on. It's important the person takes responsibility for clearing the clutter from their home. The therapist will support and encourage this. Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders. If a person is willing to get help then they may feel more comfortable contacting a therapist themselves. They can refer themselves directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think (cognitive) and act (behaviour). It encourages you to talk about how you think about yourself, the world and other people, and how what you do affects your thoughts and feelings. Regular sessions of CBT over a long period of time are usually necessary and will almost always need to include some home-based sessions, working directly on the clutter. This requires motivation, commitment and patience, as it can take many months to achieve the treatment goal. The goal is to improve the person's decision-making and organisational skills, help them overcome urges to save and, ultimately, clear the clutter, room by room. The therapist won't throw anything away but will help guide and encourage the person to do so. The therapist can also help the person develop decision-making strategies, while identifying and challenging underlying beliefs that contribute to the hoarding problem. The person gradually becomes better at throwing things away, learning that nothing terrible happens when they do and becomes better at organising items they insist on keeping. At the end of treatment, the person may not have cleared all their clutter, but they will have gained a better understanding of their problem. They will have a plan to help them continue to build on their successes and avoid slipping back into their old ways."
"Treatment - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can be treated. The treatment recommended will depend on how much it's affecting your life. The 2 main treatments are: talking therapy – usually a type of therapy that helps you face your fears and obsessive thoughts without ""putting them right"" with compulsions. medicine – usually a type of antidepressant medicine that can help by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain. A short course of therapy is usually recommended for relatively mild OCD. If you have more severe OCD, you may need a longer course of combined therapy and medicine. These treatments can be very effective, but it's important to be aware that it can take several months before you notice the benefit. You can get treatment on the NHS through a GP. You can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Find an NHS talking therapies service If you’re under 18, or want to get help for someone under 18, find out how to get mental health support for children and young people . Talking therapy. Therapy for OCD is usually a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves: working with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts, such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions. encouraging you to face your fears and have obsessive thoughts without neutralising them with compulsive behaviours; you start with situations that cause the least anxiety first, before moving on to more difficult thoughts. The treatment may be hard work, but many people find that when they confront their obsessions, the anxiety eventually improves or goes away. People with fairly mild OCD usually need about 8 to 20 sessions of therapist treatment, with exercises done at home between sessions. If you have more severe OCD, you may need a longer course of treatment. Medicine. You may need medicine if talking therapy does not help treat your OCD, or if your OCD is fairly severe. The main medicines prescribed are a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . An SSRI can help improve OCD symptoms by increasing the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. You may need to take an SSRI for up to 12 weeks before you notice any benefit. Most people need treatment for at least a year. You may be able to stop if you have few or no troublesome symptoms after this time, although some people need to take an SSRI for many years. Do not stop taking an SSRI without speaking to your doctor first because suddenly stopping can cause unpleasant side effects. Treatment will be stopped gradually to reduce the chance of getting side effects. Your dose may need to be increased again if your symptoms return. Side effects. Possible side effects of SSRIs include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious. feeling or being sick. diarrhoea or constipation. dizziness. sleeping problems (insomnia). headaches. changes to your sex life. There's also a very small chance that SSRIs could cause you to have suicidal thoughts or want to self-harm . If this happens, contact a GP or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) . Most side effects improve after a few weeks as your body gets used to the medicine, although some can persist. Pregnancy. SSRIs can be prescribed if you're pregnant or become pregnant, but this depends on whether your GP thinks the benefits outweigh the risks. Talk to them to help you decide what treatment is best for you. It's important to look after your mental health during pregnancy as it can affect both you and your baby. Find out more about help for mums with OCD on the Maternal OCD website . Further treatment. Further treatment by a specialist team may sometimes be necessary if you've tried talking therapy and medicine and your OCD is still not under control. Some people with severe, long-term and difficult-to-treat OCD may be referred to a national specialist OCD service. These services offer assessment and treatment to people with OCD who have not responded to treatments available from their local and regional OCD services. OCD UK has more information about NHS Specialist OCD Treatment Services , including adult and child and adolescent services. OCD support groups. Many people with OCD find support groups helpful, as they can: provide reassurance and coping advice. reduce feelings of isolation. offer a chance to socialise with others. provide information and advice for family members and friends. The national charities OCD Action , OCD-UK and TOP UK can provide information about support groups in your area: OCD Action support groups. OCD-UK support groups. TOP UK support groups. You may want to visit the HealthUnlocked OCD forum , where you can discuss all aspects of the condition with others who have OCD."
"Self-help - Generalised anxiety disorder in adults. If you have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), there are many ways to help ease the symptoms of anxiety yourself. Try a book or online course. There are lots of books and courses that can help you learn to cope with your anxiety. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends trying treatments based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . CBT is a type of psychological treatment that can help you manage your anxiety by changing negative or unhelpful thoughts and behaviour. Exercise regularly. Regular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, may help you combat stress and release tension. It also encourages your brain to release serotonin, which can improve your mood. Examples of good aerobic exercises include: walking fast or jogging. swimming. cycling. tennis. hiking. football or rugby. aerobics. You should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week. Moderate-intensity exercise should raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster. Learn to relax. As well as regular exercise, learning how to relax is important. You may find relaxation and breathing exercises helpful, or you may prefer activities such as yoga or pilates to help you unwind. You can also try listening to this 6-minute anxiety control training audio guide. Avoid caffeine. Drinking too much caffeine can make you more anxious than normal. This is because caffeine can disrupt your sleep and also speed up your heartbeat. If you're tired, you're less likely to be able to control your anxious feelings. Avoiding drinks containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, fizzy drinks and energy drinks, may help reduce your anxiety levels. Healthy living. Taking steps to enjoy a healthier lifestyle can help boost both your physical and mental health which can also help combat feelings of anxiety. Steps you can take include: take regular exercise. eat a healthy balanced diet. quit smoking if you smoke. drink alcohol in moderation and stick to the recommended unit consumption levels. Contact support groups. Support groups can give you advice on how to manage your anxiety. They're also a good way to meet other people with similar experiences. Examples of support groups you may find useful include: Anxiety UK. Mind. Rethink Mental Illness. Support groups can often arrange face-to-face meetings, where you can talk about your difficulties and problems with other people. Many support groups also provide support and guidance over the phone or in writing. Ask your GP about local support groups for anxiety in your area, or search online for mental health information and support services near you ."
"Diagnosis - Agoraphobia. Speak to your GP if you think you have agoraphobia. If you're unable to visit your GP in person, it should be possible to arrange a telephone consultation. Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they occur, and in what situations. It's very important to tell your GP about how you've been feeling and how your symptoms are affecting you. They'll also want to know how your symptoms are affecting your daily behaviour. For example, they may ask: Do you find it stressful leaving the house? Are there certain places or situations you have to avoid? Have you adopted any avoidance strategies to help cope with your symptoms, such as relying on others to shop for you? It can be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment. Physical examination. Your GP may want to do a physical examination, and in some cases they may decide to carry out blood tests to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. For example, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause symptoms that are similar to the symptoms of a panic attack . By ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your GP will be able to make the correct diagnosis. Confirming the diagnosis. A diagnosis of agoraphobia can usually be made if: you're anxious about being in a place or situation where escape or help may be difficult if you feel panicky or have a panic attack, such as in a crowd or on a bus. you avoid situations described above, or endure them with extreme anxiety or the help of a companion. there's no other underlying condition that may explain your symptoms. If there's any doubt about the diagnosis, you may be referred to a psychiatrist for a more detailed assessment."
"Treatment - Agoraphobia. A stepped approach is usually recommended for treating agoraphobia and any underlying panic disorder. The steps are as follows: Find out more about your condition, the lifestyle changes you can make, and self-help techniques to help relieve symptoms. Enrol yourself on a guided self-help programme. Undertake more intensive treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), or see if your symptoms can be controlled using medicine. Self-help techniques and lifestyle changes. Learning more about agoraphobia and its association with panic disorder and panic attacks may help you control your symptoms better. For example, there are techniques you can use during a panic attack to bring your emotions under control. Having more confidence in controlling your emotions may make you more confident coping with previously uncomfortable situations and environments. Stay where you are – try to resist the urge to run to a place of safety during a panic attack; if you're driving, pull over and park where it's safe to do so. Focus – it's important for you to focus on something non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch, or items in a supermarket; remind yourself the frightening thoughts and sensations are a sign of panic and will eventually pass. Breathe slowly and deeply – feelings of panic and anxiety can get worse if you breathe too quickly; try to focus on slow, deep breathing while counting slowly to 3 on each breath in and out. Challenge your fear – try to work out what it is you fear and challenge it; you can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear is not real and will pass. Creative visualisation – during a panic attack, try to resist the urge to think negative thoughts, such as ""disaster""; instead, think of a place or situation that makes you feel peaceful, relaxed or at ease: once you have this image in your mind, try to focus your attention on it. Do not fight an attack – trying to fight the symptoms of a panic attack can often make things worse; instead, reassure yourself by accepting that although it may seem embarrassing and your symptoms may be difficult to deal with, the attack is not life threatening. Making some lifestyle changes can also help. For example, ensure you: take regular exercise – exercise can help relieve stress and tension and improve your mood. have a healthy diet – a healthy, balanced diet and weight can help maintain overall health. avoid using drugs and alcohol – they may provide short-term relief, but in the long term they can make symptoms worse. avoid drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee or cola – caffeine has a stimulant effect and can make your symptoms worse. Talking therapies. If your symptoms do not respond to self-help techniques and lifestyle changes, your GP may suggest trying a talking therapy. If you prefer, you can refer yourself directly for talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), without seeing your GP.  If you’re under 18, or want to get help for someone under 18, find out how to get mental health support for children and young people . Guided self-help. With guided self-help you work through a CBT-based workbook or computer course with the support of a therapist. The therapist works with you to understand your problems and make positive changes in your life. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour. CBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave more positively. For example, many people with agoraphobia have the unrealistic thought that if they have a panic attack it will kill them. The CBT therapist will try to encourage a more positive way of thinking – for example, although having a panic attack may be unpleasant, it is not fatal and will pass. This shift in thinking can lead to more positive behaviour in terms of a person being more willing to confront situations that previously scared them. CBT is usually combined with exposure therapy. Your therapist will set relatively modest goals at the start of treatment, such as going to your local corner shop. As you become more confident, more challenging goals can be set, such as going to a large supermarket or having a meal in a busy restaurant. A course of CBT usually consists of 12 to 15 weekly sessions, with each session lasting about an hour. Applied relaxation. Applied relaxation is based on the premise that people with agoraphobia and related panic disorder have lost their ability to relax. The aim of applied relaxation is therefore to teach you how to relax. This is achieved using a series of exercises designed to teach you how to: spot the signs and feelings of tension. relax your muscles to relieve tension. use these techniques in stressful or everyday situations to prevent you feeling tense and panicky. As with CBT, a course of applied relaxation therapy consists of 12 to 15 weekly sessions, with each session lasting about an hour. Medicine. Sometimes medicine can be used as a sole treatment for agoraphobia. In more severe cases, it can also be used in combination with CBT or applied relaxation therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). If medicine is recommended for you, you'll usually be prescribed a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . SSRIs were originally developed to treat depression , but they've also proved effective for helping treat other mood disorders, such as anxiety, feelings of panic, and obsessional thoughts. An SSRI called sertraline is usually recommended for people with agoraphobia. Side effects associated with sertraline include: feeling sick. loss of sex drive (libido). blurred vision. diarrhoea or constipation. feeling agitated or shaky. excessive sweating. These side effects should improve over time, although some can occasionally persist. If sertraline fails to improve your symptoms, you may be prescribed an alternative SSRI or a similar type of medicine known as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The length of time you'll have to take an SSRI or SNRI for will vary depending on your response to treatment. Some people may have to take SSRIs for 6 to 12 months or more. When you and your GP decide it's appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you'll be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. You should never stop taking your medicine unless your GP specifically advises you to. Pregabalin. If you're unable to take SSRIs or SNRIs for medical reasons or you experience troublesome side effects, another medicine called pregabalin may be recommended. Dizziness and drowsiness are common side effects of pregabalin.  Support groups. Charities like Mind and Anxiety Care UK are useful resources for information and advice about how to manage anxiety and phobias. They can also put you in touch with other people who've had similar experiences."
"Self-help - Phobias. Each phobia is different and no single self-help programme will work for everyone. You may decide to use your own self-help strategy or get help from a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist. A self-help programme could include: lifestyle changes. a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). attending a self-help group. using exposure therapy to overcome your fear. a combination of these. Lifestyle changes. Making some simple changes to your lifestyle may help reduce the symptoms of a phobia , such as panic attacks . This could include: regular exercise. eating regular, healthy meals. getting enough sleep. reducing or avoiding caffeine and other stimulants. Exposure therapy (desensitisation). Exposure therapy involves gradually increasing the length of time you're exposed to your phobia. For example, if you have agoraphobia , a fear of open spaces and public places, you might start by going outside your house for a very short period of time, before gradually increasing the length of time you spend outside and the distance you travel from your house. Exposure therapy can be a very effective way of enabling you to cope with your anxiety . Other self-help techniques. Other self-help techniques include: relaxation techniques – a series of physical exercises that help you relax and control your breathing. visualisation – combines relaxation and breathing techniques with mentally visualising how you'll successfully deal with a situation that could cause anxiety. self-help groups – a useful way of meeting others with similar experiences and sharing ways of coping. "
"Symptoms - Phobias. Phobias can limit your daily activities and may cause severe anxiety and depression. Complex phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia, are more likely to cause these symptoms. People with phobias often purposely avoid coming into contact with the thing that causes them fear and anxiety . For example, someone with a fear of spiders (arachnophobia) may not want to touch a spider or even look at a picture of one. In some cases, a person can develop a phobia where they become fearful of experiencing anxiety itself because it feels so uncomfortable. You don't have to be in the situation you're fearful of to experience the symptoms of panic . The brain is able to create a reaction to fearsome situations even when you aren't actually in the situation. Physical symptoms. People with phobias can have panic attacks . These can be very frightening and distressing. The symptoms often occur suddenly and without warning. As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can cause physical symptoms, such as: sweating. trembling. hot flushes or chills. shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. a choking sensation. rapid heartbeat (tachycardia). pain or tightness in the chest. a sensation of butterflies in the stomach. nausea. headaches and dizziness. feeling faint. numbness or pins and needles. dry mouth. a need to go to the toilet. ringing in your ears. confusion or disorientation. Psychological symptoms. In severe cases, you may also experience psychological symptoms, such as: fear of losing control. fear of fainting. feelings of dread. fear of dying. Complex phobias. Complex phobias such as agoraphobia and social phobia can often have a detrimental effect on a person's everyday life and mental wellbeing. Agoraphobia often involves a combination of several interlinked phobias. For example, someone with a fear of going outside or leaving their home may also have a fear of being left alone (monophobia) or of places where they feel trapped (claustrophobia). The symptoms experienced by people with agoraphobia can vary in severity. For example, some people can feel very apprehensive and anxious if they have to leave their home to go to the shops. Others may feel relatively comfortable travelling short distances from their home. If you have a social phobia, the thought of being seen in public or at social events can make you feel frightened, anxious and vulnerable. Intentionally avoiding meeting people in social situations is a sign of social phobia. In extreme cases of social phobia, as with agoraphobia, some people are too afraid to leave their home. Several treatments for phobias are available, including talking therapies and self-help techniques . However, it can often take some time to overcome a complex phobia."
"Treatment - Phobias. Many people with a phobia don't need treatment and avoiding the object of their fear is enough to control the problem. However, it may not always be possible to avoid certain phobias, such as a fear of flying. In this instance, you may decide to get professional help and advice to find out about treatment options. Most phobias are treatable, but no single treatment is guaranteed to work for all phobias. In some cases, a combination of different treatments may be recommended. The main treatment types are: self-help techniques. talking treatments. medication. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Find an NHS talking therapies service Talking treatments. Talking treatments, such as counselling , are often very effective at treating phobias. In particular, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been found to be very effective for treating phobias. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of counselling that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. It can be used to develop practical ways of dealing with your phobia. One part of the CBT treatment process that's often used to treat simple phobias involves gradual exposure to your fear, so you feel less anxious about it. This is known as desensitisation or exposure therapy. For example, if you have a fear of snakes (ophidiophobia), your therapist may start by asking you to read about snakes. They may later show you a picture of a snake. They may then arrange for you to visit the reptile house of your local zoo to look at some real snakes. The final step would be for you to hold a snake. Exposure therapy works by gradually increasing the level of exposure to your fear, which allows you to gain control over your phobia. As the treatment progresses, you should begin to feel less anxious about your phobia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) doesn't recommend the use of computerised CBT to treat specific phobias in adults. Medication. Medication isn't usually recommended for treating phobias, because talking therapies are usually effective and don't have any side effects. However, medication may sometimes be prescribed to treat the effects of phobias, such as anxiety . There are different types of medication that may be prescribed. Antidepressants. Antidepressants are often prescribed to help reduce anxiety. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are most often prescribed to treat anxiety, social phobia or panic disorder . These can include: escitalopram (Cipralex). sertraline (Lustral). paroxetine (Seroxat). Venlafaxine (Efexor), a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) may also be prescribed for anxiety. Common side effects of these treatments include: nausea. headaches. sleep problems (insomnia). upset stomach. They may also, initially, make your anxiety worse and can cause sexual problems. Clomipramine (Anafranil) is a type of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that's licensed to treat some phobias. Side effects include: dry mouth. drowsiness. blurred vision. tremors (shaking). heart palpitations. constipation. difficulty urinating. Moclobemide (Manerix) is a type of antidepressant from the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) group of antidepressants. It's sometimes prescribed to treat social phobia. Moclobemide interacts with certain types of food, so if you're prescribed this medication, read the information leaflet that comes with it to find out which foods to avoid. Other possible side effects of moclobemide include: sleep problems. dizziness. stomach problems. headaches. restlessness. If you're prescribed antidepressants, it's very important that you don't suddenly stop taking them. Suddenly stopping can cause withdrawal symptoms. See your GP, who can gradually lower your dose. Tranquillisers. Benzodiazepines are a group of medicines that are categorised as minor tranquillisers. They include medicines such as diazepam (Valium) and are sometimes used on a short-term basis at the lowest possible dose to treat severe anxiety. Like antidepressants, benzodiazepines should be stopped gradually to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Beta blockers. Beta blockers are often used to treat cardiovascular conditions, such as heart problems and high blood pressure (hypertension) . They are also sometimes prescribed to help reduce the symptoms of anxiety, such as heart palpitations . Beta blockers slow down your heart rate and decrease your blood pressure. Propranolol (Inderal) is a beta blocker that's commonly used to treat anxiety. Possible side effects include: stomach problems. cold fingers. tiredness. sleep problems."
"Causes - Phobias. A phobia can develop during childhood, adolescence or early adulthood. They can be linked to a frightening event or stressful situation. However, it's not always clear why some phobias occur. Specific or simple phobias. Specific or simple phobias, such as a fear of heights (acrophobia), usually develop during childhood. Simple phobias can be linked to an early negative childhood experience. For example, if you're trapped in a confined space when you're young, you may develop a fear of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) when you're older. It's also thought that phobias can sometimes be ""learnt"" from an early age. For example, if someone in your family has a fear of spiders (arachnophobia), you may also develop the same fear yourself. Other factors in the family environment, such as having parents who are particularly anxious, may also affect the way you deal with anxiety later in life. Complex phobias. It's not known what causes complex phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia . However, it's thought that genetics , brain chemistry and life experiences may all play a part in these type of phobias. The physical reactions (symptoms) a person experiences when faced with the object of their fear are real and aren't simply ""in their head"". The body reacts to the threat by releasing the hormone adrenaline, which causes symptoms such as: sweating. trembling. shortness of breath. a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)."

"Raising low self-esteem. We all have times when we lack confidence and do not feel good about ourselves. But when low self-esteem becomes a long-term problem, it can have a harmful effect on our mental health and our day-to-day lives. What is self-esteem? Self-esteem is the opinion we have of ourselves. When we have healthy self-esteem, we tend to feel positive about ourselves and about life in general. It makes us better able to deal with life's ups and downs. When our self-esteem is low, we tend to see ourselves and our life in a more negative and critical light. We also feel less able to take on the challenges that life throws at us. What causes low self-esteem? Low self-esteem often begins in childhood. Our teachers, friends, siblings, parents, and even the media send us positive and negative messages about ourselves. For some reason, the message that you are not good enough is the one that stays with you. Perhaps you found it difficult to live up to other people's expectations of you, or to your own expectations. Stress and difficult life events, such as serious illness or a bereavement , can have a negative effect on self-esteem. Personality can also play a part. Some people are just more prone to negative thinking, while others set impossibly high standards for themselves. How does low self-esteem affect us? If you have low self-esteem or confidence, you may hide yourself away from social situations, stop trying new things, and avoid things you find challenging. In the short term, avoiding challenging and difficult situations might make you feel safe. In the longer term, this can backfire because it reinforces your underlying doubts and fears. It teaches you the unhelpful rule that the only way to cope is by avoiding things. Living with low self-esteem can harm your mental health and lead to problems such as depression and anxiety . You may also develop unhelpful habits, such as smoking and drinking too much, as a way of coping. How to have healthy self-esteem. To boost your self-esteem, you need to identify the negative beliefs you have about yourself, then challenge them. You may tell yourself you're ""too stupid"" to apply for a new job, for example, or that ""nobody cares"" about you. Start to note these negative thoughts and write them on a piece of paper or in a diary. Ask yourself when you first started to think these thoughts. Next, start to write some evidence that challenges these negative beliefs, such as, ""I'm really good at cryptic crosswords"" or ""My sister calls for a chat every week"". Write down other positive things about yourself, such as ""I'm thoughtful"" or ""I'm a great cook"" or ""I'm someone that others trust"". Also write some good things that other people say about you. Aim to have at least 5 positive things on your list and add to it regularly. Then put your list somewhere you can see it. That way, you can keep reminding yourself that you're OK. You might have low confidence now because of what happened when you were growing up, but we can grow and develop new ways of seeing ourselves at any age. Other ways to improve low self-esteem. Here are some other simple techniques that may help you feel better about yourself. Recognise what you're good at. We're all good at something, whether it's cooking, singing, doing puzzles or being a friend. We also tend to enjoy doing the things we're good at, which can help boost your mood. Build positive relationships. If you find certain people tend to bring you down, try to spend less time with them, or tell them how you feel about their words or actions. Try to build relationships with people who are positive and who appreciate you. Be kind to yourself. Being kind to yourself means being gentle to yourself at times when you feel like being self-critical. Think what you'd say to a friend in a similar situation. We often give far better advice to others than we do to ourselves. Learn to be assertive. Being assertive is about respecting other people's opinions and needs, and expecting the same from them. One trick is to look at other people who act assertively and copy what they do. It's not about pretending you're someone you're not. It's picking up hints and tips from people you admire and letting the real you come out. Start saying ""no"". People with low self-esteem often feel they have to say yes to other people, even when they do not really want to. The risk is that you become overburdened, resentful, angry and depressed. For the most part, saying no does not upset relationships. It can be helpful to keep saying no, but in different ways, until they get the message. Give yourself a challenge. We all feel nervous or afraid to do things at times. But people with healthy self-esteem do not let these feelings stop them trying new things or taking on challenges. Set yourself a goal, such as joining an exercise class or going to a social occasion. Achieving your goals will help to increase your self-esteem. Where to find help for low self-esteem. Talking therapies like counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help. You can refer yourself for talking therapies on the NHS. Find a talking therapies service in your area If you prefer, you can talk to a GP first and they can refer you. You could also find a private therapist. Make sure they're registered with a professional body."

"Psychotic depression. Some people who have severe depression may also experience hallucinations and delusional thinking, the symptoms of psychosis. Depression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression. Symptoms of depression. Someone with depression feels sad and hopeless for most of the day, practically every day, and has no interest in anything. Getting through the day feels almost impossible. Other typical symptoms of depression may include: fatigue (exhaustion). disturbed sleep. changes in appetite. feeling worthless and guilty. being unable to concentrate or being indecisive. thoughts of death or suicide. Doctors describe depression as mild, moderate or severe depending on your symptoms, how long it lasts and how much it affects your daily life. Symptoms of psychosis. Having moments of psychosis (when people lose some contact with reality) means experiencing: delusions – thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true. hallucinations – hearing and, in some cases, feeling, smelling, seeing or tasting things that are not there; hearing voices is a common hallucination. The delusions and hallucinations almost always reflect the person's deeply depressed mood – for example, they may become convinced they're to blame for something, or that they've committed a crime. ""Psychomotor agitation"" is also common. This means not being able to relax or sit still, and constantly fidgeting. At the other extreme, a person with psychotic depression may have ""psychomotor retardation"", where both their thoughts and physical movements slow down. People with psychotic depression have an increased risk of thinking about suicide. What causes psychotic depression? The cause of psychotic depression is not fully understood. It's known that there's no single cause of depression and it has many different triggers. Genes probably play a part, as severe depression can run in families. Life events and personal circumstances can be the cause for some people. This can include bereavement , relationship problems, financial problems, health problems and recent or past traumatic experiences. It's not known why some people with severe depression also develop psychosis. Treating psychotic depression. Treatment for psychotic depression involves: medicine – a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis. talking therapies – the 1-to-1 talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved effective in helping some people with severe depression, including those with psychosis. social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment or accommodation. The person may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time while they're receiving treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may sometimes be recommended if the person has severe depression and other treatments, including antidepressants, have not worked. The mental health charity Mind has more information on ECT . Treatment is usually effective, but follow-up appointments so that the person can be closely monitored are usually required. Getting help for others. People with psychosis are often unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely. As a result of this lack of insight, it's often down to the person's friends, relatives or carers to seek help for them. If you're concerned about someone and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or mental health team if they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. Contact the person's GP if this is the first time they've shown symptoms of psychosis . If you think the person's symptoms are placing them or others at possible risk of harm you can: take them to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree. call a GP or use an NHS urgent and emergency care service. call 999 to ask for an ambulance. Further information. The following websites provide further information and support: SANE. Mind: psychosis. Driving. If you've been diagnosed with psychotic depression, it's your legal obligation to tell the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) . You must not drive until you have been assessed as safe to do so."
"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. These flaws are often unnoticeable to others. People of any age can have BDD, but it's most common in teenagers and young adults. It affects both men and women. Having BDD does not mean you're vain or self-obsessed. It can be very upsetting and have a big impact on your life. Symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). You might have body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) if you: worry a lot about a specific area of your body (particularly your face). spend a lot of time comparing your looks with other people's. look at yourself in mirrors a lot or avoid mirrors altogether. go to a lot of effort to conceal flaws – for example, by spending a long time combing your hair, applying make-up or choosing clothes. pick at your skin to make it ""smooth"". BDD can seriously affect your daily life, including your work, social life and relationships. BDD can also lead to depression , self-harm and even thoughts of suicide . Getting help for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). You should see a GP if you think you might have BDD. They'll probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect your life. They may also ask if you've had any thoughts about harming yourself. You may be treated by the GP, or they may refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment. It can be very difficult to seek help for BDD, but it's important to remember that you have nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. Getting help is important because your symptoms probably will not go away without treatment and may get worse. You can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP. Find an NHS talking therapies service Treatments for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can get better with treatment. If your symptoms are relatively mild, you should be referred for a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , which you have either on your own or in a group. If you have moderate symptoms, you should be offered either CBT or a type of antidepressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . If your symptoms are more severe, or other treatments do not work, you should be offered CBT together with an SSRI. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT can help you manage your BDD symptoms by changing the way you think and behave. It helps you learn what triggers your symptoms, and teaches you different ways of thinking about and dealing with your habits. You and your therapist will agree on goals for the therapy and work together to try to reach them. CBT for treating BDD will usually include a technique known as exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves gradually facing situations that would normally make you think obsessively about your appearance and feel anxious. Your therapist will help you to find other ways of dealing with your feelings in these situations so that, over time, you become able to deal with them without feeling self-conscious or afraid. You may also be given some self-help information to read at home and your CBT might involve group work, depending on your symptoms. CBT for children and young people will usually also involve their family members or carers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs are a type of antidepressant . There are a number of different SSRIs, but fluoxetine is most commonly used to treat BDD. It may take up to 12 weeks for SSRIs to have an effect on your BDD symptoms. If they work for you, you'll probably be asked to keep taking them for several months to improve your symptoms further and stop them coming back. There are some common side effects of taking SSRIs , but these will often pass within a few weeks. Your doctor will keep a close eye on you over the first few weeks. It's important to tell them if you're feeling particularly anxious or emotional, or are having thoughts of harming yourself. If you've not had symptoms for 6 to 12 months, you'll probably be taken off SSRIs. This will be done by slowly reducing your dose over time to help make sure your symptoms do not come back (relapse) and to avoid any side effects of coming off the drug (withdrawal symptoms), such as anxiety. Children, adults younger than 30, and all people with a history of suicidal behaviour will need to be carefully monitored when taking SSRIs. This is because they may have a higher chance of developing suicidal thoughts or trying to hurt themselves in the early stages of treatment. Children and young people may be offered an SSRI if they're having severe symptoms of BDD. Medicine should only be suggested after they have seen a psychiatrist and been offered talking therapies. Further treatment. If treatment with both CBT and an SSRI has not improved your BDD symptoms after 12 weeks, you may be prescribed a different type of SSRI or another antidepressant called clomipramine. If you do not see any improvements in your symptoms, you may be referred to a mental health clinic or hospital that specialises in BDD, such as the National OCD/BDD Service in London. These services will probably do a more in-depth assessment of your BDD. They may offer you more CBT or a different kind of therapy, as well as a different kind of antidepressant. Causes of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). It's not known exactly what causes body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), but it might be associated with: genetics – you may be more likely to develop BDD if you have a relative with BDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression. a chemical imbalance in the brain. a traumatic experience in the past – you may be more likely to develop BDD if you were teased, bullied or abused when you were a child. Some people with BDD also have another mental health condition, such as obsessive compulsive behaviour (OCD) , generalised anxiety disorder or an eating disorder . Things you can do to help with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Support groups for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Some people may find it helpful to contact or join a support group for information, advice and practical tips on coping with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). You can ask your doctor if there are any groups in your area, and the BDD Foundation has a directory of local and online BDD support groups . You may also find the following organisations to be useful sources of information and advice: Anxiety UK. International OCD Foundation. Mind. OCD Action. OCD UK. Mental wellbeing. Things that can help with your mental wellbeing if you have BDD include: taking regular exercise. making sure you get enough sleep. Some people also find it helpful to get together with friends or family, or to try doing something new to improve their mental wellbeing. It may also be helpful to try some relaxation and breathing exercises to relieve stress and anxiety."
"Claustrophobia. Claustrophobia is the irrational fear of confined spaces. People affected by claustrophobia will often go out of their way to avoid confined spaces, such as lifts, tunnels, tube trains and public toilets. But avoiding these places may reinforce the fear. Some people with claustrophobia experience mild anxiety when in a confined space, while others have severe anxiety or a panic attack. It's estimated around 10% of the UK population are affected by claustrophobia during their lifetime. Triggers of claustrophobia. Many different situations or feelings can trigger claustrophobia. Even thinking about certain situations without exposure to them could be a trigger. Common triggers of claustrophobia include: lifts. tunnels. tube trains. public toilets. rooms where the doors have to be locked. cars. hotel rooms with sealed windows. planes. If you have felt anxious in the last 6 months about being in a confined space or crowded place, or you have avoided these situations for this reason, it's likely that you're affected by claustrophobia. MRI scan anxiety. If you have claustrophobia and need to have an MRI scan , let the staff at the hospital know before the day of your appointment. You can talk to your consultant about having a sedative to help you relax. You should do this well in advance of having the scan. In some cases, you may be able to attend an open or upright MRI centre, designed for people with severe MRI anxiety. But these clinics are often only available privately. Symptoms of claustrophobia. People with claustrophobia can have panic attacks . They can be very frightening and distressing. As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, claustrophobia can also cause physical symptoms, such as: sweating. trembling. hot flushes or chills. shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. a choking sensation. a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia). chest pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest. a sensation of butterflies in the stomach. feeling sick. headaches and dizziness. feeling faint. numbness or pins and needles. a dry mouth. a need to go to the toilet. ringing in your ears. feeling confused or disorientated. If you have severe claustrophobia, you may also experience psychological symptoms, such as: fear of losing control. fear of fainting. feelings of being detached from your body. fear of dying. What causes claustrophobia? Claustrophobia is often caused by a traumatic event experienced during early childhood. For example, adults may develop claustrophobia if, as a child, they: were trapped or kept in a confined space. were bullied or abused. had a parent with claustrophobia. Claustrophobia can also be triggered by unpleasant experiences or situations, such as turbulence when flying or being stuck in a tube tunnel between stations. A child growing up with a parent who has claustrophobia may develop claustrophobia themselves by associating confined spaces with their parent's anxiety and feeling helpless to comfort the person they loved. Treating claustrophobia. Many people live with claustrophobia without having it formally diagnosed and take great care to avoid confined spaces. But getting help from a GP or a specialist with expertise in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologist, can often be beneficial. Treatments are available for claustrophobia and can include: talking treatments, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy. self-help - find out more about phobias and self-care on the Mind website. medicines, such as antidepressants or tranquilisers. CBT is a talking therapy that explores your thoughts, feelings and behaviour, and develops practical ways of effectively dealing with your phobia. You can get free talking therapies, including CBT, on the NHS. You do not need a referral from your GP. You can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service. If you prefer, talk to a GP and they can refer you. Exposure therapy is a type of CBT that gradually exposes you to the situation that causes your fear. It's sometimes also known as desensitisation therapy. You can do it by yourself or with the help of a professional. Find out more about CBT and exposure therapy . Coping with a panic attack. If possible, stay where you are during a panic attack. It could last up to an hour, so if you're driving, you may need to pull over and park where it's safe to do so. Do not rush to a place of safety. During the attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations are a sign of panic and will eventually pass. Focus on something non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket. The symptoms of a panic attack usually peak within 10 minutes, with most attacks lasting between 5 and 30 minutes. Help and support. Charities, such as Anxiety UK and Anxiety Care UK , are useful sources of information and advice about how to effectively manage anxiety and phobias. They can also put you in touch with other people who have had similar experiences. Anxiety UK runs a helpline on 03444 775774 that's open Monday to Friday from 9.30 am to 5.30 pm. Calls are charged at the local rate. You can contact Anxiety Care UK by email at support@anxietycare.org.uk for advice and support."
"Cyclothymia. Cyclothymia, or cyclothymic disorder, causes mood changes – from feeling low to emotional highs. Cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder . Most people's symptoms are mild enough that they do not seek mental health treatment, or the emotional highs feel nice, so they do not realise there's anything wrong or want to seek help. This means cyclothymia often goes undiagnosed and untreated. But the mood swings can affect daily life, and cause problems with personal and work relationships. If you think you have cyclothymia, it's important to seek help from a GP. People with cyclothymia are at risk of developing full bipolar disorder, so it's important to get help before reaching this stage. People can get cyclothymia at any age. Symptoms of cyclothymia. If you have cyclothymia, you'll have periods of feeling low followed by periods of feeling very happy and excited (called hypomania) when you do not need much sleep, are more sociable and impulsive and feel that you have a lot of energy. The periods of low mood do not last long enough and are not severe enough to be diagnosed as depression . You might feel sluggish and lose interest in things during these periods, but this should not stop you going about your day-to-day life. Mood swings will be fairly frequent – you will not go for longer than 2 months without experiencing low mood or an emotional high. Doctors may diagnose cyclothymia if you've had symptoms for at least 2 years, or 1 year for children and teenagers. Symptoms of cyclothymia are not severe enough for you to be diagnosed with full bipolar disorder, and your mood swings will be broken up by periods of normal mood. Treatment for cyclothymia. Treatment usually involves some kind of talking therapy (psychotherapy). You may also need medicines. The aim is to: stop the cyclothymia developing into full bipolar disorder. reduce your symptoms. stop your symptoms coming back. Psychotherapy. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may help with cyclothymia. CBT involves talking to a trained therapist to find ways to help you manage your symptoms by changing the way you think and behave. You'll be given practical ways to improve your state of mind on a daily basis. Medicines. You may be prescribed medicines to level out your mood (mood stabilisers). Mood stabilisers include: lithium – commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. epilepsy medicines – such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or sodium valproate. Some antipsychotics such as quetiapine are also sometimes used as mood stabilisers. But not all people with cyclothymia need or respond to medicine. The charity Mind has more information on lithium and other mood stabilisers . Further support for cyclothymia. You may also find it helpful to join a support group so you can talk to others who share your experiences and problems. You can ask your mental health service or GP if there's a local group you can join. Other organisations that can help include: Bipolar UK. Mind. Rethink Mental Illness. Living with cyclothymia. It's not known how many people with cyclothymia will go on to develop full bipolar disorder . But some people with cyclothymia see their elevated or depressed moods become more severe. Other people will find their cyclothymia continues and they need to manage this as a lifelong condition. Causes of cyclothymia. The causes of cyclothymia are not known, but there's probably a genetic link because cyclothymia, depression and bipolar disorder all tend to run in families. In some people, traumatic events or experiences may act as a trigger for the condition, such as severe illness or long periods of stress ."
"Dissociative disorders. Dissociative disorders are a range of conditions that can cause physical and psychological problems. Some dissociative disorders are very short-lived, perhaps following a traumatic life event, and resolve on their own over a matter of weeks or months. Others can last much longer. Symptoms of a dissociative disorder. Symptoms of dissociative disorder can vary but may include: feeling disconnected from yourself and the world around you. forgetting about certain time periods, events and personal information. feeling uncertain about who you are. having multiple distinct identities. feeling little or no physical pain. Some people with dissociative disorders have seizures. These can vary from fainting to something more like an epileptic seizure. Dissociation is a way the mind copes with too much stress. Periods of dissociation can last for a relatively short time (hours or days) or for much longer (weeks or months). Many people with a dissociative disorder have had a traumatic event during childhood. Dissociation can happen as a way of coping with it. Types of dissociative disorder. There are several different types of dissociative disorder. The 3 main types are: depersonalisation-derealisation disorder. dissociative amnesia. dissociative identity disorder. Depersonalisation-derealisation disorder. Depersonalisation is where you have the feeling of being outside yourself and observing your actions, feelings or thoughts from a distance. Derealisation is where you feel the world is unreal. People and things around you may seem ""lifeless"" or ""foggy"". You can have depersonalisation or derealisation, or both together. It may last only a few moments or come and go over many years. Dissociative amnesia. Someone with dissociative amnesia will have periods where they cannot remember information about themselves or events in their past life. They may also forget a learned talent or skill. These gaps in memory are much more severe than normal forgetfulness and are not the result of another medical condition. Some people with dissociative amnesia find themselves in a strange place without knowing how they got there. They may have travelled there on purpose, or wandered in a confused state. These blank episodes may last minutes, hours or days. In rare cases, they can last months or years. Dissociative identity disorder. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) used to be called multiple personality disorder. Someone diagnosed with DID may feel uncertain about their identity and who they are. They may feel the presence of other identities, each with their own names, voices, personal histories and mannerisms. The main symptoms of DID are: memory gaps about everyday events and personal information. having several distinct identities. Associated conditions. Someone with a dissociative disorder may also have other mental health conditions, such as: medically unexplained symptoms. post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). depression. mood swings. anxiety and panic attacks. suicidal tendencies or self-harm. an eating disorder. obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They may also have problems sleeping ( insomnia ). Causes of dissociative disorder. There are many possible causes of dissociative disorders, including previous traumatic experience. Someone with a dissociative disorder may have experienced physical, sexual or emotional abuse during childhood. Some people dissociate after experiencing war, kidnapping or even an invasive medical procedure. Switching off from reality is a normal defence mechanism that helps the person cope during a traumatic time. It's a form of denial, as if ""this is not happening to me"". It becomes a problem when the environment is no longer traumatic but the person still acts and lives as if it is, and has not dealt with or processed the event. Diagnosing dissociative disorders. A GP may examine you and do some tests to check if another illness might be the cause of your symptoms. They may also refer you to a mental health specialist for a full assessment. Assessment. The specialist who carries out your assessment should have a good understanding of dissociative disorders. The assessment may include questions about your thoughts, feelings, behaviour and your symptoms. It's important to be honest about your symptoms and not to feel ashamed or embarrassed, so you can receive the help and support you need. Treatments for dissociative disorders. Many people with a dissociative disorder make a full recovery with treatment and support. Talking therapies. Talking therapies are often recommended for dissociative disorders. The aim of talking therapies such as counselling or psychotherapy is to help you cope with the underlying cause of your symptoms, and to learn and practise techniques to manage the periods of feeling disconnected. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological treatment that can help reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is sometimes used to treat dissociative disorders. Medicines. There's no specific medicine to treat dissociation, but medicines like antidepressants may be prescribed to treat associated conditions like depression, anxiety and panic attacks. If you're feeling suicidal. If you have thoughts about taking your life, it's important you ask someone for help. It's probably difficult for you to see it at this time, but you're not alone or beyond help. There are people you can talk to who want to help: speak to a friend, family member or someone you trust, as they may be able to help you calm down and find some breathing space. call the Samaritans free 24-hour support service on 116 123. go to your nearest A&E and tell the staff how you're feeling. contact NHS 111. make an urgent appointment to see a GP. What to do if you're worried about someone. If you're worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, try to encourage them to talk about how they're feeling. Listening is the best way to help. Try to avoid offering solutions and try not to judge. If they have previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team. They will offer help and advice but cannot share information about the person without consent. Further help and support. If you have a dissociative disorder, getting help and support is an important part of the recovery process. Talking to your partner, family and friends about your experience of dissociative disorder can help them understand how you feel. Mental health charity Mind has more information on dissociative disorders and a list of support organisations. Reading about other people with similar experiences may also help. You can read people's personal accounts of living with a number of different mental health conditions on   healthtalk.org ."
"Overview - Fabricated or induced illness. Fabricated or induced illness (FII) is a rare form of child abuse. It happens when a parent or carer exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in the child. The parent or carer tries to convince doctors that the child is ill, or that their condition is worse than it really is. The parent or carer does not necessarily intend to deceive doctors, but their behaviour is likely to harm the child. For example the child may have unnecessary treatment or tests, be made to believe they're ill, or have their education disrupted. FII used to be known as ""Munchausen's syndrome by proxy"" (not to be confused with Munchausen's syndrome , where a person pretends to be ill or causes illness or injury to themselves). Signs of fabricated or induced illness. Fabricated or induced illness (FII) covers a wide range of symptoms and behaviours involving parents or carers seeking healthcare for a child. This ranges from exaggerating or inventing symptoms, to deliberately making the child ill. Behaviours in FII can include a parent or carer who: persuades healthcare professionals that their child is ill when they're healthy. exaggerates or lies about their child's symptoms. manipulates test results to suggest the child is ill, for example, by putting glucose in urine samples to suggest the child has diabetes. deliberately induces symptoms of illness, for example, by poisoning their child with unnecessary medicine or other substances. Cases where the parent or carer wrongly reports symptoms are much more common than cases where they induce illness in the child. Learn more about the signs of fabricated or induced illness . Why fabricated or induced illness happens. The reasons why FII happens are not fully understood. The parent or carer will have a need for their child to be treated as if they're ill, or as being more unwell than they really are. Their behaviour is intended to convince doctors that the child is ill. This may be because the parent or carer gains something, such as attention, support or closeness to the child. Or it may be because they have anxiety or incorrect beliefs about their child's health, and they need these beliefs to be confirmed and acted upon. The parent or carer is not always fully aware of the reasons for their own behaviour. A large number of parents or carers involved in FII have borderline personality disorders characterised by emotional instability, impulsiveness and disturbed thinking. Some parents or carers involved in FII have so-called ""somatoform disorders"", where they experience multiple, recurrent physical symptoms. A proportion of these parents or carers also have Munchausen's syndrome. Some parents or carers have unresolved psychological and behavioural problems, such as a history of self-harming , or drug or alcohol misuse . Some have experienced the death of another child. There have also been several reported cases where illness was fabricated or induced for financial reasons. For example, to claim disability benefits.  What to do if you suspect a child is at risk. FII is a child safeguarding issue and cannot be managed by the NHS alone. Medical professionals who suspect FII is happening should liaise with social services and the police, and must follow local child safeguarding procedures. If your job involves working with children, for example, if you're a nursery worker or teacher, tell the person in your organisation who's responsible for child safeguarding issues. If you do not know who this is, your immediate supervisor or manager should be able to tell you. If you suspect someone you know may be fabricating or inducing illness in their child, do not confront them directly. It's unlikely to make the person admit to wrongdoing, and it may give them the opportunity to dispose of any evidence of abuse. You can contact your local social services department, or telephone the NSPCC's child protection helpline on 0808 800 5000, or email the NSPCC at help@NSPCC.org.uk . The helpline is open from 10 am to 4 pm Monday to Friday.  How a case is managed. The child. The first priority is to protect the child, find out their true state of health and restore them to good health. Health professionals will create a health and education rehabilitation plan for the child. The local authority children's social care team may also be involved. They may remove the child from the care of the person responsible. If the child is in hospital, the parent or carer may need to be removed from the ward. The child may need help returning to a normal lifestyle, including going back to school. Younger children and babies who do not understand what was happening often make a good recovery after the abuse stops. Older children, particularly those who've been abused for many years, may have more problems. For example, many affected children believe they're really ill. They need help and support to develop a more realistic understanding of their health. It's common for older children to feel loyal to their parent or carer, and a sense of guilt if that person is removed from the family. The parent or carer. Once the child is safe, it may be possible to treat the parent or carer's underlying psychological problems. This may include a combination of: intensive psychotherapy. family therapy. The aim of psychotherapy is to uncover and resolve the issues that caused the person to fabricate or induce illness in the child. Family therapy aims to resolve any tensions within the family, improve parenting skills and attempt to repair the relationship between the parent or carer and the child. In more severe cases, the parent or carer may be compulsorily detained in a psychiatric ward under the Mental Health Act so their relationship with the child can be closely monitored. Parents or carers involved in FII are difficult to treat because most do not admit their deceptions and refuse to recognise their abusive behaviour. In some cases, the child is permanently removed from their care. The best results are achieved in cases where the parent or carer: understands and acknowledges the harm they've caused. is able to communicate the underlying motivations and needs that led them to fabricate or cause illness. is able to work together with healthcare and other professionals."
"Overview - Munchausen syndrome. Munchausen syndrome is a psychological condition where someone pretends to be ill or deliberately produces symptoms of illness in themselves. Their main intention is to assume the ""sick role"" so that people care for them and they are the centre of attention. Any practical benefit in pretending to be sick – for example, claiming incapacity benefit – is not the reason for their behaviour. Munchausen syndrome is named after a German aristocrat, Baron Munchausen, who became famous for telling wild, unbelievable tales about his exploits. Types of behaviour. People with Munchausen syndrome can behave in a number of different ways, including: pretending to have psychological symptoms – for example, claiming to hear voices or claiming to see things that are not really there. pretending to have physical symptoms – for example, claiming to have chest pain or a stomach ache. actively trying to get ill – such as deliberately infecting a wound by rubbing dirt into it. Some people with Munchausen syndrome may spend years travelling from hospital to hospital faking a wide range of illnesses. When it's discovered they're lying, they may suddenly leave hospital and move to another area. People with Munchausen syndrome can be very manipulative and, in the most serious cases, may undergo painful and sometimes life-threatening surgery, even though they know it's unnecessary. What causes Munchausen syndrome? Munchausen syndrome is complex and poorly understood. Many people refuse psychiatric treatment or psychological profiling, and it's unclear why people with the syndrome behave the way they do. Several factors have been identified as possible causes of Munchausen syndrome. These include: emotional trauma or illness during childhood – this often resulted in extensive medical attention. a personality disorder – a mental health condition that causes patterns of abnormal thinking and behaviour. a grudge against authority figures or healthcare professionals. Childhood trauma. Munchausen syndrome may be caused by parental neglect and abandonment, or other childhood trauma. As a result of this trauma, a person may have unresolved issues with their parents that cause them to fake illness. They may do this because they: have a compulsion to punish themselves by making themselves ill because they feel unworthy. need to feel important and be the centre of attention. need to pass responsibility for their wellbeing and care on to other people. There's also some evidence to suggest people who have had extensive medical procedures, or received prolonged medical attention during childhood or their teenage years, are more likely to develop Munchausen syndrome when they're older. This may be because they associate their childhood memories with a sense of being cared for. As they get older, they try to obtain the same feelings of reassurance by pretending to be ill. Personality disorders. Different personality disorders thought to be linked with Munchausen syndrome include: antisocial personality disorder – where a person may take pleasure in manipulating and deceiving doctors, giving them a sense of power and control. borderline personality disorder – where a person struggles to control their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others. narcissistic personality disorder – where a person often swings between seeing themselves as special and fearing they're worthless. It could be that the person has an unstable sense of their own identity and also has difficulty forming meaningful relationships with others. Playing the ""sick role"" allows them to adopt an identity that brings support and acceptance from others with it. Admission to hospital also gives the person a clearly defined place in a social network. Diagnosing Munchausen syndrome. Diagnosing Munchausen syndrome can be challenging for medical professionals. People with the syndrome are often very convincing and skilled at manipulating and exploiting doctors. Investigating claims. If a healthcare professional suspects a person may have Munchausen syndrome, they'll look at the person's health records to check for inconsistencies between their claimed and actual medical history. Healthcare professionals can also run tests to check for evidence of self-inflicted illness or tampering with clinical tests. For example, the person's blood can be checked for traces of medicine they should not be taking but which could explain their symptoms. Doctors will also want to rule out other possible motivations for their behaviour, such as faking illness for financial gain or because they want access to strong painkillers. Munchausen syndrome can usually be diagnosed if: there's clear evidence of fabricating or inducing symptoms. the person's prime motivation is to be seen as sick. there's no other likely reason or explanation for their behaviour. Treating Munchausen syndrome. Treating Munchausen syndrome can be difficult because most people with it refuse to admit they have a problem and refuse to co-operate with treatment plans. Some experts recommend that healthcare professionals should adopt a gentle non-confrontational approach, suggesting the person may benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist. Others argue that a person with Munchausen syndrome should be confronted directly and asked why they've lied and whether they have stress and anxiety. People who have Munchausen syndrome have a genuine mental health condition, but will often only admit to having a physical illness. If a person admits to their behaviour, they can be referred to a psychiatrist for further treatment. If they do not admit to lying, most experts agree the doctor in charge of their care should minimise medical contact with them. This is because the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust and if there's evidence the patient can no longer be trusted, the doctor is unable to continue treating them. Psychiatric treatment and CBT. It may be possible to help control the symptoms of Munchausen syndrome if the person admits they have a problem and co-operates with treatment. There's no standard treatment for Munchausen syndrome, but a combination of psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some success controlling symptoms. Psychoanalysis is a type of psychotherapy that attempts to uncover and resolve unconscious beliefs and motivations. CBT helps a person identify unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns. A specially trained therapist teaches the person ways of replacing unrealistic beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones. Family therapy. People with Munchausen syndrome still in close contact with their family may also benefit from having family therapy. The person with the syndrome and their close family members discuss how it's affected the family and the positive changes that can be made. It can also teach family members how to avoid reinforcing the person's abnormal behaviour. For example, this could involve recognising when the person is playing the ""sick role"" and avoiding showing them concern or offering support. Who's affected by Munchausen syndrome? There appear to be 2 separate groups of people affected by Munchausen syndrome. They are: women who are 20 to 40 years of age, often with a background in healthcare. unmarried white men who are 30 to 50 years of age. It's unclear why these 2 groups tend to be affected by Munchausen syndrome. Some experts believe Munchausen syndrome is underdiagnosed because many people succeed in deceiving medical staff. It's also possible cases may be overdiagnosed as the same person could use different identities. Fabricated or induced illness. Fabricated or induced illness , which used to be known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, is a related condition. This is where a person fakes or induces illness in a person under their care, such as their child."
"Signs and symptoms - Munchausen syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Munchausen syndrome may include pretending to be ill, or self-harming to aggravate or induce illness. There are 4 main ways people with Munchausen syndrome fake or induce illnesses: lying about symptoms – for example, choosing symptoms that are difficult to disprove, such as having a severe headache or pretending to have a seizure or to pass out. tampering with test results – for example, heating a thermometer to suggest a fever or adding blood to a urine sample. self-infliction – for example, cutting or burning themselves, poisoning themselves with drugs, or eating food contaminated with bacteria. aggravating conditions – for example, rubbing poo into wounds to cause an infection, or re-opening previously healed wounds. Clues to Munchausen syndrome. Some clues that a person may have Munchausen syndrome include: making frequent visits to hospitals in different areas. claiming to have a history of complex and serious medical conditions with no or little supporting evidence – people often claim they've spent a long time out of the country. having symptoms that do not match test results. having symptoms that get worse for no apparent reason. having very good medical knowledge. receiving few or no hospital visitors – many people with Munchausen syndrome have a solitary lifestyle and have little contact with friends or family. being willing to undergo often painful or dangerous tests and procedures. reporting symptoms that are vague and inconsistent, or reporting a pattern of symptoms that are ""textbook examples"" of certain health conditions. telling unbelievable and often very elaborate stories about their past – such as claiming to be a decorated war hero or that their parents are fantastically rich and powerful. Munchausen by internet. Munchausen by internet is relatively new. It's where a person joins an internet support group for people with a serious health condition, such as cystic fibrosis or leukaemia, and then claims to have the illness themselves. While these actions may only be confined to the internet, they can have a significant negative impact on support groups and online communities. For example, people with genuine health conditions have reported feeling angry and betrayed when they discover they've been lied to. Signs that suggest someone's online posts may not be genuine include: posts and messages that contain large chunks of information and appear to have been directly copied from health websites, such as NHS.UK. reports of having symptoms that appear to be much more severe than most people would experience. making claims of near-fatal bouts of illness followed by a miraculous recovery. making fantastic claims that they later contradict or are shown to be false – for example, they may claim to be attending a certain hospital that does not actually exist. claiming to have continual dramatic events in their life, such as loved ones dying or being the victim of a violent crime, particularly when other group members have become a focus of attention. pretending to be unconcerned when they talk about serious problems, probably to attract attention and sympathy. other ""people"" claiming to post on their behalf, such as a parent or partner, but they use exactly the same style of writing."
"Signs - Fabricated or induced illness. The abuse that happens in fabricated or induced illness (FII) takes a range of forms and can be difficult to recognise, but there are warning signs to look out for. Warning signs. A clinician may suspect fabricated or induced illness if, after carrying out examinations and tests, there appears to be no explanation for the child's symptoms. For more information, you can read the NICE guidance about when to suspect child maltreatment in under 18 s . They should also look out for 1 or more of the following warning signs: symptoms only appear when the parent or carer is present. the only person claiming to notice symptoms is the parent or carer. the parent or carer does not let healthcare professionals see the child on their own. the parent or carer talks for the child, or the child refers to the parent or carer rather than speaking for themselves. the child has an inexplicably poor response to medicine or other treatment. if 1 particular health problem is resolved, the parent or carer may then begin reporting a new set of symptoms. the child's alleged symptoms do not seem plausible – for example, a child who has supposedly lost a lot of blood but does not become unwell. the parent or carer has a history of frequently changing GPs or visiting different hospitals for treatment, particularly if their views about the child's treatment are challenged by medical staff. the child's daily activities are being limited far beyond what you would usually expect for a certain condition – for example, they never go to school or have to wear leg braces even though they can walk properly. the parent or carer does not accept reassurance or recommended treatment, and insists on continued investigations or new treatments. the parent or carer encourages medical staff to perform often painful tests and procedures on the child (tests that most parents would only agree to if they were persuaded that it was absolutely necessary). Types of abuse in FII. Previous case reports of FII have uncovered evidence of parents or carers: exaggerating, distorting or lying about their child's symptoms, medical history, tests or diagnoses. falsifying documents. deliberately contaminating or manipulating clinical tests to fake evidence of illness, for example, by adding blood or sugar to urine samples. poisoning their child with unsuitable and non-prescribed medicine. infecting their child's wounds or injecting the child with dirt or poo. inducing unconsciousness by suffocating their child. not treating or mistreating genuine conditions so they get worse. withholding food, resulting in the child failing to develop physically and mentally at the expected rate."
"Causes - Fabricated or induced illness. It's not fully understood why some parents or carers fabricate or induce illness in their child. The parent or carer may gain something, such as attention or support, from the child being treated as ill. Or they may have anxiety or incorrect beliefs about the child's health. It's likely the parent or carer will have a mental health condition or a history of previous traumatic experiences that helps to explain their behaviour. Child abuse. Research has found some parents and carers who were known to have fabricated or induced illness in their child were victims of physical and sexual abuse during their own childhood. But most people who are abused as children do not go on to abuse their own children. Previous medical history. One or both parents may have a history of self-harm or drug or alcohol misuse . Some case studies also revealed that the mother may have experienced the death of another child, or a difficult pregnancy. Personality disorder. A high proportion of parents and carers involved in FII have been found to have a personality disorder and, in particular, a borderline personality disorder . Personality disorders are a type of mental health problem where a person has a distorted pattern of thoughts and beliefs about themselves and others. These distorted thoughts and beliefs may cause them to behave in ways that most people would regard as disturbed and abnormal. A borderline personality disorder is characterised by emotional instability, disturbed thinking, impulsive behaviour, and intense but unstable relationships with others. It's important to note that not everyone with borderline personality disorder goes on to abuse their children. Sometimes, people with personality disorders find reward in behaviour or situations that other people would find intensely distressing. It's thought that some parents or carers who carry out FII find the situation of their child being under medical care rewarding. Other parents or carers who've been involved in FII have reported feeling a sense of resentment towards their child because they have a happy childhood, unlike their own. Anxiety disorder. Some parents have an anxiety disorder that makes them have unfounded anxieties about their child's health. Some parents also have health anxiety about themselves. They may be motivated by genuine worries about the child, but because these worries are unfounded their behaviour can harm the child. Somatic symptom disorder. Some parents have a somatic symptom disorder, or somatoform disorder. This means they genuinely feel pain or other symptoms, but it's related to underlying emotional difficulties rather than physical health conditions."
"What happens - Fabricated or induced illness. It can be very difficult to confirm a suspected case of fabricated or induced illness (FII). Healthcare professionals will naturally assume that a parent or carer will always act in the best interests of a child in their care, unless there's strong evidence to suggest otherwise. They will also want to make sure they do not miss any genuine health conditions. If FII is suspected. If a healthcare professional notices signs of FII, they'll usually refer the case to a community paediatrician. A senior paediatrician will examine the medical evidence to determine whether there's a clinical explanation for the child's symptoms. They may also seek further specialist advice and arrange further testing. They will consider whether the child should be admitted to hospital so that nurses can observe them directly. If the senior paediatrician also suspects FII, they'll put together a detailed record of all the available information related to the child's treatment and involvement with health services. They'll explore how the family is functioning, the parents' views, and the child's views if they're old enough. They'll record their concerns in the child's health records, so that any other clinicians who see the child are aware of the concerns. Healthcare professionals will meet to discuss the concerns and agree on whether the signs can be explained by a diagnosed health condition, or whether it appears to be a case of FII. The parents will usually be told the outcome of the meeting, and future plans will be discussed with them. If there's thought to be a risk of harm to the child, healthcare professionals will also refer the case to children's social care. Health and education rehabilitation plan. Whether or not the child is referred to children's social care, healthcare professionals will create a health and education rehabilitation plan for the child. The plan will cover the actions needed to resolve the situation and help the child recover, such as: stopping any unnecessary medicines or treatment. getting the child back to school. psychological support for the child and the family. Doctors will usually lead on creating the plan, and education and social care professionals may also be involved. The child's parents or carers will be asked to support the plan. A lead professional (usually a paediatrician or other health professional, or sometimes a social worker) will review the plan regularly with the family, until the child is healthy and there are no longer any concerns. If the parents or carers will not agree to a plan, or do not support it, the child will be referred to children's social care who will take any steps needed to prevent harm. Referral to children's social care. If the child may be at risk of harm, for example if there's evidence that the parent or carer may be making the child ill, healthcare professionals will refer the case to the local authority children's social care team and the police. They will decide whether to tell the parents or carers about the referral. Children's social care teams consist of a number of different professionals. They're employed by local authorities responsible for protecting children from abuse and neglect. Other agencies involved with the child's welfare, such as their school or social services, may be contacted in case they have information that's relevant, such as the child being absent from school. The children's social care team will usually ask the healthcare professionals to provide a detailed record of the past events in the child's medical history. Once complete, the information will be presented to the children's social care team and the police. The social care, police and medical staff will meet to discuss the best way to proceed with the case. Child protection plan. If the child is thought to be at immediate risk of physical harm, children's social care will remove them from the care of the parent or carer. The child may be placed in the care of another relative or in foster care. In many cases of suspected FII, the child is already in hospital. They'll be moved to a safe place inside the hospital so that their medical assessment can continue. Alternatively, the parent or carer may be banned from the child's ward. As the child is commonly at risk of significant physical or mental harm, a child protection plan is drawn up. This plan takes into account the child's health and safety needs, as well as their educational or social needs. For example, the child may have been deprived of regular education because their parent or carer kept them away from school. As part of the child protection plan, the parent or carer may be asked to have a psychiatric assessment or family therapy. If they refuse to comply with the child protection plan, the child may be removed from their care. Police investigation. If the police decide there's enough evidence to bring criminal charges, they'll investigate the case. In rare cases, covert (secret) video surveillance may be used to collect evidence that can help to confirm a suspected case of FII. Only the police have the legal authority to do this, and it's only done if there's no other way of getting information needed to explain the child's symptoms. Further information. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) has published information and guidance about the protection of children in cases of FII: RCPCH guidance: perplexing presentations and fabricated or induced illness in children."
"Selective mutism. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder where a person is unable to speak in certain social situations, such as with classmates at school or to relatives they do not see very often. It usually starts during childhood and, if left untreated, can persist into adulthood. A child or adult with selective mutism does not refuse or choose not to speak at certain times, they're literally unable to speak. The expectation to talk to certain people triggers a freeze response with feelings of anxiety and panic, and talking is impossible. In time, the person may learn to anticipate the situations that provoke this distressing reaction and do all they can to avoid them. However, people with selective mutism are able to speak freely to certain people, such as close family and friends, when nobody else is around to trigger the freeze response. Selective mutism affects about 1 in 140 young children. It's more common in girls and children who have recently migrated from their country of birth. Signs of selective mutism. Selective mutism can start at any age, but most often starts in early childhood, between age 2 and 4. It's often first noticed when the child starts to interact with people outside their family, such as when they begin nursery or school. The main warning sign is the marked contrast in the child's ability to engage with different people, characterised by a sudden stillness and frozen facial expression when they're expected to talk to someone who's outside their comfort zone. They may avoid eye contact and appear: nervous, uneasy or socially awkward. rude, disinterested or sulky. clingy. shy and withdrawn. stiff, tense or poorly co-ordinated. stubborn or aggressive, having temper tantrums when they get home from school, or getting angry when questioned by parents. More confident children with selective mutism can use gestures to communicate – for example, they may nod for ""yes"" or shake their head for ""no"". But more severely affected children tend to avoid any form of communication – spoken, written or gestured. Some children may manage to respond with a few words, or they may speak in an altered voice, such as a whisper. What causes selective mutism. Experts regard selective mutism as a fear ( phobia ) of talking to certain people. The cause is not always clear, but it's known to be associated with anxiety. The child will usually have a tendency to anxiety and have difficulty taking everyday events in their stride. Find out more about anxiety in children . Many children become too distressed to speak when separated from their parents and transfer this anxiety to the adults who try to settle them. If they have a speech and language disorder or hearing problem, it can make speaking even more stressful. Some children have trouble processing sensory information such as loud noise and jostling from crowds – a condition known as sensory integration dysfunction. This can make them ""shut down"" and be unable to speak when overwhelmed in a busy environment. Again, their anxiety can transfer to other people in that environment. When mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress , it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty. Another misconception is that a child with selective mutism is controlling or manipulative, or has autism . There's no relationship between selective mutism and autism, although a child may have both. Diagnosing selective mutism. Left untreated, selective mutism can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder . It can continue into adolescence and adulthood if not managed. Diagnosis in children. A child can successfully overcome selective mutism if it's diagnosed at an early age and appropriately managed. It's important for selective mutism to be recognised early by families and schools so they can work together to reduce a child's anxiety. Staff in early years settings and schools may receive training so they're able to provide appropriate support. If you suspect your child has selective mutism and help is not available, or there are additional concerns – for example, the child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines – speak to a GP and ask them to refer you to a local specialist service for a formal diagnosis. You can also contact a speech and language therapy clinic directly. Do not accept the opinion that your child will grow out of it or they are ""just shy"". Your GP or local integrated care board (ICB) should be able to give you the telephone number of your nearest NHS speech and language therapy service or another specialist service that can help in your area. Your child may also need to see a mental health professional or school educational psychologist. The clinician may initially want to talk to you without your child present, so you can speak freely about any anxieties you have about your child's development or behaviour. They'll want to find out whether there's a history of anxiety disorders in the family, and whether anything is causing distress, such as a disrupted routine or difficulty learning a second language. They'll also look at behavioural characteristics and take a full medical history. A person with selective mutism may not be able to speak during their assessment, but the clinician should be prepared for this and be willing to find another way to communicate. For example, they may encourage a child with selective mutism to communicate through their parents, or suggest that older children or adults write down their responses or use a computer. They may watch the child playing or watch a video of them speaking in a comfortable environment. Diagnosis in adults. It's possible for adults to overcome selective mutism, although they may continue to experience the psychological and practical effects of spending years without social interaction or not being able to reach their academic or occupational potential. Adults will ideally be seen by a mental health professional with access to support from a speech and language therapist or another knowledgeable professional. Diagnosis guidelines. Selective mutism is diagnosed according to specific guidelines. These include observations about the person concerned as outlined: they do not speak in specific situations, such as during school lessons or when they can be overheard in public. they can speak normally in situations where they feel comfortable, such as when they're alone with parents at home, or in their empty classroom or bedroom. their inability to speak to certain people has lasted for at least 1 month (2 months in a new setting). their inability to speak interferes with their ability to function in that setting. their inability to speak is not better explained by another behavioural, mental or communication disorder. Associated difficulties. A child with selective mutism will often have other fears and social anxieties , and they may also have additional speech and language difficulties. They're often wary of doing anything that draws attention to them because they think that by doing so, people will expect them to talk. For example, a child may not do their best in class after seeing other children being asked to read out good work, or they may be afraid to change their routine in case this provokes comments or questions. Many have a general fear of making mistakes. Accidents and urinary infections may result from being unable to ask to use the toilet and holding on for hours at a time. School-aged children may avoid eating and drinking throughout the day so they do not need to excuse themselves. Children may have difficulty with homework assignments or certain topics because they're unable to ask questions in class. Teenagers may not develop independence because they're afraid to leave the house unaccompanied. And adults may lack qualifications because they're unable to participate in college life or subsequent interviews. Treating selective mutism. With appropriate handling and treatment, most children are able to overcome selective mutism. But the older they are when the condition is diagnosed, the longer it will take. The effectiveness of treatment will depend on: how long the person has had selective mutism. whether or not they have additional communication or learning difficulties or anxieties. the co-operation of everyone involved with their education and family life. Treatment does not focus on the speaking itself, but reducing the anxiety associated with speaking. This starts by removing pressure on the person to speak. They should then gradually progress from relaxing in their school, nursery or social setting, to saying single words and sentences to one person, before eventually being able to speak freely to all people in all settings. The need for individual treatment can be avoided if family and staff in early years settings work together to reduce the child's anxiety by creating a positive environment for them. This means: not letting the child know you're anxious. reassuring them that they'll be able to speak when they're ready. concentrating on having fun. praising all efforts the child makes to join in and interact with others, such as passing and taking toys, nodding and pointing. not showing surprise when the child speaks, but responding warmly as you would to any other child. As well as these environmental changes, older children may need individual support to overcome their anxiety. Cognitive behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) helps a person focus on how they think about themselves, the world and other people, and how their perception of these things affects their thoughts and feelings. CBT also challenges fears and preconceptions through graded exposure. Behavioural therapy. Behavioural therapy concentrates on helping combat current difficulties using a gradual step-by-step approach to help conquer fears. Techniques. There are several techniques based on CBT and behavioural therapy that are useful in treating selective mutism. These can be used at the same time by individuals, family members and school or college staff, possibly under the guidance of a speech and language therapist or psychologist. Graded exposure In graded exposure, situations causing the least anxiety are tackled first. With realistic targets and repeated exposure, the anxiety associated with these situations decreases to a manageable level. Older children and adults are encouraged to work out how much anxiety different situations cause, such as answering the phone or asking a stranger the time. Stimulus fading In stimulus fading, the person with selective mutism communicates at ease with someone, such as their parent, when nobody else is present. Another person is gradually introduced into the situation and, once they're included in talking, the parent withdraws. The new person can introduce more people in the same way. Shaping Shaping involves using any technique that enables the person to gradually produce a response that's closer to the desired behaviour. For example, starting with non-verbal communication, gradually moving to making eye contact, saying short words and then longer sentences and, finally, 2-way conversation. Positive and negative reinforcement Positive and negative reinforcement involves responding favourably to all forms of communication and not inadvertently encouraging avoidance and silence. If the child is under pressure to talk, they'll experience great relief when the moment passes, which will strengthen their belief that talking is a negative experience. Desensitisation Desensitisation is a technique that involves reducing the person's sensitivity to other people hearing their voice by sharing voice or video recordings. For example, email or instant messaging could progress to an exchange of voice recordings or voicemail messages, then more direct communication, such as telephone or Skype conversations. You could also record your child at home and encourage them to watch or listen to themselves speaking. Medicine. Medicine is only really appropriate for older children, teenagers and adults whose anxiety has led to depression and other problems. Medicine should never be prescribed as an alternative to environmental changes and behavioural approaches. Though some health professionals recommend using a combination of medicine and behavioural therapies in adults with selective mutism. However, antidepressants may be used alongside a treatment programme to decrease anxiety levels, particularly if previous attempts to engage the individual in treatment have failed. Advice for parents. Do not pressurise or bribe your child to encourage them to speak. Let your child know you understand they're scared to speak and have difficulty speaking at times. Tell them they can take small steps when they feel ready and reassure them that talking will get easier. Do not praise your child publicly for speaking because this can cause embarrassment. Wait until you're alone with them and consider a special treat for their achievement. Reassure your child that non-verbal communication, such as smiling and waving, is fine until they feel better about talking. Do not avoid parties or family visits, but consider what environmental changes are necessary to make the situation more comfortable for your child. Ask friends and relatives to give your child time to warm up at his or her own pace and focus on fun activities rather than getting them to talk. As well as verbal reassurance, give them love, support and patience. Getting help and support. Teenagers and adults with selective mutism can find information and support at iSpeak and the Facebook group SM SpaceCafe . The Selective Mutism Information and Research Association (SMiRA) is another good resource for people affected by selective mutism. There's also a SMiRA Facebook page . The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and the Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice can help you find professionals in your area with experience in treating selective mutism."
"Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder). Trichotillomania, also known as trich or TTM, is when someone cannot resist the urge to pull out their hair.

If your GP thinks you have trich, you may be referred for a type of treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . If you are under 18, this may be offered through your local children and young people's mental health services . Treating trichotillomania. Trich is commonly treated using a type of CBT called habit reversal training. This aims to help you replace a bad habit with something that's not harmful. Treatment usually involves: keeping a diary of your hair pulling. working out the triggers for your hair pulling and learning how to avoid them. replacing hair pulling with another action, like squeezing a stress ball. loved ones providing emotional support and encouragement. Antidepressants are not usually prescribed to treat trich. Things you can try yourself. Here are some tips from people with trich that may help when you feel the urge to pull your hair: squeeze a stress ball or something similar. form a ball with your fist and tighten the muscles in that arm. use a fidget toy. wear a bandana or a tight-fitting hat, such as a beanie. take a soothing bath to ease any stress or anxiety. practise deep breathing until the urge to pull goes away. exercise. put plasters on your fingertips. cut your hair short. Getting support. It may also help to open up about your trich to people you trust, as hiding it can sometimes make your anxiety worse.

"Mental Health Act. In most cases when people are treated in hospital or another mental health facility, they have agreed or volunteered to be there. They may be referred to as a voluntary patient. But there are cases when a person can be detained, also known as sectioned, under the Mental Health Act (1983) and treated without their agreement. The Mental Health Act (1983) is the main piece of legislation that covers the assessment, treatment and rights of people with a mental health disorder. You can read the Mental Health Act on the government legislation website . People detained under the Mental Health Act need urgent treatment for a mental health disorder and are at risk of harm to themselves or others. Advice for carers and families. If your loved one has been detained, they will have to stay in hospital until the doctors or a mental health tribunal decide otherwise. You still have the right to visit. Visiting arrangements depend on the hospital, so check visiting hours with staff or on the hospital website. In some cases the patient may refuse visitors, and hospital staff will respect the patient's wishes. If you're unable to see your loved one, staff should explain why. With permission from your loved one, doctors may discuss the treatment plan with you. You can also raise concerns or worries with the doctors and nurses on the ward. Hospital accommodation should be age and gender-appropriate. Not all hospitals will be able to offer a ward dedicated to each gender, but all should at least offer same-sex toilets and washing facilities. For more information: browse Rethink's guide on going into hospital – for carers, friends and relatives. read or download easy read factsheets, which explain in simple terms a person's rights and choices when detained under the Mental Health Act. Who decides that someone should be detained? In emergencies. An emergency is when someone seems to be at serious risk of harming themselves or others. Police have powers to enter your home, if need be by force, under a Section 135 warrant. You may then be taken to, or kept at, a place of safety for an assessment by an approved mental health professional and a doctor. You can be kept there until the assessment is completed, for up to 24 hours. This can be extended to 36 hours, if it wasn't possible to assess you in that time. If the police find you in a public place (anywhere that is not your home) and you appear to have a mental health disorder and are in need of immediate care or control, they can take you to a place of safety (usually a hospital or sometimes the police station) and detain you there under Section 136. You'll then be assessed by an approved mental health professional and a doctor. You can be kept there until the assessment is completed, for up to 24 hours. This can be extended to 36 hours, if it wasn't possible to assess you in that time. If you're already in hospital, certain nurses can stop you leaving under Section 5(4) until the doctor in charge of your care or treatment, or their nominated deputy, can make a decision about whether to detain you there under Section 5(2). Section 5(4) gives nurses the ability to detain someone in hospital for up to 6 hours. Section 5(2) gives doctors the ability to detain someone in hospital for up to 72 hours, during which time you should receive an assessment that decides if further detention under the Mental Health Act is necessary. Non-emergencies. In most non-emergency cases, family members, a GP, carer or other professionals may voice concerns about your mental health. They should discuss this with you, and together you should make a decision about what help you may need, such as making an appointment with your GP to discuss further options. But there may be times when there are sufficient concerns about your mental health and your ability to make use of the help offered. In these circumstances your relatives or the professionals involved in your care can ask for a formal assessment of your mental health through the Mental Health Act process. Your nearest relative has the right to ask the local approved mental health professional service, which may be run by local social care services, for an assessment under the Mental Health Act. It's also possible for a court to consider using the Mental Health Act in some circumstances, or for a transfer to a hospital to take place from prison. As part of this formal process, you'll be assessed by doctors and an approved mental health professional. One of the doctors must be specially certified as having particular experience in the assessment or treatment of mental illness. The length of time you could be detained for depends on the type of mental health condition you have and your personal circumstances at the time. You could be detained for: up to 28 days under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. up to 6 months under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act, with further renewals. During these periods, assessments will be regularly carried out by the doctor in charge of your care to determine whether it's safe for you to be discharged and what further treatment is required, if any. You should always be given information about your rights under the Mental Health Act. What does the term 'being sectioned' mean? The Mental Health Act is structured in many sections. If someone says, ""You're being sectioned under the Mental Health Act"", they mean you're detained according to a particular section of the Mental Health Act. In most cases, you'll be told which section of the Mental Health Act applied in your case. For example, ""You're detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act"". How can I appeal against being detained? Any person who's compulsorily detained has the right to appeal against the decision to the Mental Health Tribunal (MHT) or to the hospital's managers. The MHT is an independent body that decides whether you should be discharged from hospital. You may be eligible for legal aid to pay for a solicitor to help you do this. You also have the right to see an independent mental health advocate if you're detained. Ask the nurses on your ward or the hospital manager how you can get to see one. An independent mental health advocate can help you understand your rights and could also help if you're not happy with your situation. You can also make a complaint to the CQC if you're unhappy with the way the Mental Health Act has been used. Find out how to make a complaint on the CQC website. Consent to treatment. If you're held under the Mental Health Act, you can be treated against your will. This is because it's felt you do not have sufficient capacity to make an informed decision about your treatment at the time. This is also the case if you refuse treatment but the team treating you believe you should have it. The CQC provides detailed guidance about your rights in terms of consenting to medication and electroconvulsive therapy if you're detained in hospital or placed on a Community Treatment Order (CTO). Find out more on the CQC website: What is 'Section 17 leave'? Going on leave from the hospital should form an important part of your care as you recover. This means that while detained under the Mental Health Act, you may be able to leave the hospital if authorised by the doctor or clinician in charge of your care (also known as the responsible clinician). This leave is often referred to as ""section 17 leave"", as it's Section 17 of the Mental Health Act that allows this leave. The responsible clinician in charge of your care can place conditions on the leave, such as where you should stay while away from the hospital and whether this will be for a fixed period of time. You should be given a copy of the Section 17 leave form that sets out these conditions so you're clear what they are. The responsible clinician can revoke your leave and make you come back to hospital at any time. If you do not return to the hospital at the end of the leave period, you can be made to go back to the hospital. What's a Community Treatment Order? If you have been treated in hospital under the Mental Health Act and are being discharged or allowed out of the hospital on short-term leave, you may be put under a Community Treatment Order (CTO). Under Section 17 of the Act, you can get leave but can be recalled to hospital if, for example, you stop taking required medication or your condition gets worse. Make sure you know how long any leave is agreed for (usually 1 night or a weekend) before leaving the hospital. You may be recalled to hospital during the leave if there are significant concerns about how you manage in the community. If you're on leave or are being discharged, you may be made subject to a CTO if your doctor is concerned that you may not continue your treatment when you leave hospital. Generally, a CTO means you can go home under certain conditions that you have to meet. This is to protect yourself or others from harm and ensures you continue your treatment. As normally occurs when someone is discharged from hospital, you'll be assigned a care co-ordinator, who'll help you with your mental health needs. If you break the conditions of the CTO or your situation gets worse, you could be readmitted to hospital. You could be detained for up to 72 hours while a decision is made about the next steps in your care. Depending on your circumstances, your CTO could be revoked, which means you'll have to stay in hospital, or you could be allowed to leave hospital and continue your CTO. While you're on a CTO, you can appeal against it. You may be eligible for legal aid to pay for a solicitor to help you do this. You also have the right to see an independent mental health advocate and appeal to a mental health tribunal when you're on a CTO. Ask your care co-ordinator, the nurses on your ward or hospital manager how you can get to see one. An independent mental health advocate can help you understand your rights and could also help if you're not happy with any of your CTO conditions. What's the SOAD service? The second opinion appointed doctor (SOAD) service safeguards the rights of patients subject to the Mental Health Act. SOADs are consulted in certain circumstances when a patient refuses treatment, or is too ill or otherwise incapable of giving consent. They'll check whether the recommended treatment is clinically appropriate and that your views and rights have been taken into account. For example: If you have already received medication for 3 months without consent under the Mental Health Act, the SOAD has to review whether continuous medication is really necessary. If you're too ill to give valid consent to electroconvulsive therapy and your doctor feels it's necessary, the SOAD has to review whether it's appropriate for the treatment to be given. Electroconvulsive therapy cannot be given to a patient who's able to give consent but refuses to do so, except in urgent situations. What's an approved mental health professional (AMHP)? An approved mental health professional (AMHP) is a mental health worker who has received special training to provide help and give assistance to people who are being treated under the Mental Health Act. Their functions can include helping to assess whether a person needs to be compulsorily detained (sectioned) as part of their treatment. An AMHP is also responsible for ensuring that the human and civil rights of a person being detained are upheld and respected."

"Mental health assessments. A mental health assessment is a conversation between you and mental health professionals to help decide what kind of support you need. You'll need to have a mental health assessment when you go to any mental health service for help. Information: A mental health assessment is not a test or an exam. It is about helping you. You only have to talk about what you want to talk about. The more open and honest you are, the easier it will be to get you the right help. What happens during a mental health assessment? When you have a mental health assessment, you might talk to a nurse, social worker, psychologist, specialist pharmacist, psychiatrist, or a combination of these and other healthcare professionals. Bringing someone to support you. You may be able to bring a friend or relative to support you. Some people prefer to bring an advocate who can represent their views and interests. They can be volunteers, like mental health charity workers, or professionals, like lawyers. If you want to know what advocacy services are available in your area, check with your local council. What you'll talk about in your assessment. During the assessment, you and healthcare professionals will talk about your needs. The conversation might cover: mental health symptoms and experiences. feelings, thoughts and actions. physical health and wellbeing. housing and financial circumstances. employment and training needs. social and family relationships. culture and ethnic background. gender and sexuality. use of drugs or alcohol. past experiences, especially of similar problems. your safety and other people's. whether anyone depends on you, such as a child or elderly relative. strengths and skills, and what helps you best. hopes and aspirations for the future. You only have to talk about what you want to talk about but the more you're able to share, the easier it will be to find out what will work best for you. At the end of the assessment. When the professionals you're talking to have all the information they need, they'll make their assessment and explain it to you in clear language. You should get the chance to ask questions about your condition, the diagnosis, possible causes, the treatments on offer, and how those might affect your life. You should also be involved in making decisions about what treatments are best for you. You can also expect to be given information to take home, so you can think about it in your own time, as well as advice on where you can find out more. What you can do before and during the assessment. Do. think about who you could take with you for support and arrange for them to come along. make some notes about what you want to discuss before your appointment. tick each point off during the appointment, when they've been covered. ask as many questions as you need to about anything that is not clear. make sure the health professional explains things to you as many times as it takes for you to really understand it. Reviewing how it's going. Your needs can change over time so it's important your treatment is reviewed regularly. You'll always have a named person as your care co-ordinator. They should make sure you have regular reviews and you should go to them first if you’re worried about your treatment. They can also offer you support, including support for your family and friends if they need it. Your review will be a face-to-face meeting in a familiar place. That’s often the clinic, community mental health centre or GP surgery where you usually meet your care co-ordinator. If you prefer, it may be possible for the meeting to take place at your house. Or it could be at another place where you feel comfortable, like a community centre. You might want to arrange to bring someone with you, like a friend, family member or advocate. You can find out about advocacy services from your care co-ordinator or local council. You can also get advice about finding an advocate from the mental health charity Rethink . If a treatment or service is not working for you. If a treatment or mental health service is not working for you, you should say something. It's important for the mental health professional you're seeing to know about this. It might be that another approach or a new assessment is needed to find a service that's better for you. If you do not feel that your concerns are being taken seriously, ask the manager of your mental health service if you can see someone different, like another psychiatrist or care co-ordinator. Your GP might also be able to help you, if you talk to them. Getting a second opinion If you're not sure about a diagnosis or treatment suggested to you, you can ask for another medical professional to give a second opinion NHS trusts deliver NHS services locally. They usually have a system for getting second opinions and will help you see another medical professional. You can also ask your mental health professional, your GP or your care co-ordinator if they can arrange for a second opinion for you. Local voluntary groups and charities like Mind or Rethink offer advice on this, too. You do not have a legal right to a second opinion but in most cases, you should be able to get one. If your doctor refuses to pass on your request, or the mental health service refuses to offer a second opinion or a change of health professional, contact your local patient advice and liaison service (PALS). They'll give you advice on what to do next. Or you could ask an advocate to help you. Your council will be able to help you find a local advocacy service . What if I want a specialist second opinion? You might feel that your local mental health service is not specialised enough to give a proper diagnosis or treatment for your condition. If so, you might want an expert in your condition to help you instead. You can ask for a specialist second opinion on the NHS. Some mental health trusts offer specialist services. If yours does not, they’ll have to find a specialist somewhere else. Specialist services usually focus on one condition or problem, especially if that condition is complex or severe. Conditions that may require a specialist service are: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). eating disorders. severe conditions before, during and after pregnancy, including postpartum psychosis. gender identity conditions. those needing specialist neuropsychiatry services. If you want an independent opinion from a specialist, your psychiatrist might agree that's a good idea and help you find the right specialist. Or your GP can arrange this for you. To make this happen, your GP might need to contact your local integrated care board (ICB). ICBs are in charge of the funding for your local NHS and decide where the money should be spent. They will decide whether they'll pay for an independent opinion. Some specialist services have their own funding to cover the cost of treating people who are referred to them. They usually have information on their websites about this. Although getting a second opinion could be a difficult step that takes time, this should not stop you asking for one if you really need one. If your GP disagrees or refuses to pass on your request, ask again. Explain why you feel you need a second opinion. Include examples such as: I feel that standard treatments are not working for me. My mental health is not improving and I have been in and out of hospital, or have been in hospital for a long time. I am having side effects from the medication, which is seriously affecting my health. My doctor cannot find any answers or alternatives. It's important to explain how your diagnosis or treatment is causing problems in your life and why you think a second opinion might help. If the integrated care board (ICB) will not fund a second opinion ICBs are in charge of the funding for your local NHS and decide where the money should be spent. If your GP tells you that your request for specialist support has been refused because the ICB is not funding it, you could contact the ICB directly. Explain your reasons, maybe in writing or with an advocate, and ask them to reconsider. If you apply directly to the ICB, this is called an individual funding request (IFR). You can find the process explained on most ICB websites, as well as the application forms needed to make a claim for funding . If you're not happy with any aspect of your care, including how your request for a second opinion has been handled, you can file an official complaint using the NHS complaints procedure . Your rights under the Mental Health Act There are a few situations where decisions might be made about a person's care without their agreement, through the Mental Health Act. This is sometimes known as being sectioned. This is done to protect people who may not be able to make decisions about their care because of the effects of a mental illness."
