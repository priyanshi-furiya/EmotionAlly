"What is anger? We all feel angry at times – it's part of being human. Anger is a normal, healthy emotion. There are many different reasons why we might feel angry. We may feel anger at having been treated badly or unfairly by others. Our anger may be a reaction to difficult experiences in our daily life, our past, or in the world around us. Or it may be a way to cope with other emotions. For example, we may feel anger alongside feeling attacked, powerless, embarrassed or scared. Our page on causes of anger has more information. We may not know why we feel angry and that's okay too. We don't always need to justify or explain why we feel a certain way. Sometimes anger can be a helpful emotion. But sometimes it can be difficult to manage and make our lives harder. Learning how to recognise, express and manage anger can make a big difference to our mental health. Our page on managing your anger has some tips on how to deal with anger. How can anger be helpful? Feeling angry can sometimes be useful. For example, feeling angry about something can: Help us identify problems. Help protect us from things that are hurting us. Help us feel more energised or focused on a task. Motivate us to push for changes in the world or to help others who are being treated badly. Help us to challenge and stand against injustice or discrimination. Help us stay safe and defend ourselves in dangerous situations by giving us a burst of energy as part of our body's natural response to threats. Anger is something I had always been discouraged from feeling. But a degree of protective anger can be really healthy and healing. How can anger be unhelpful? Anger can be a difficult emotion to cope with. And we all have times where we may struggle with anger. Sometimes, anger can: Distract us from what we need to do. Make us say or do things we regret. Make it harder for us to express ourselves clearly or calmly. Lead to arguments or conflict with others. Make us feel guilty and ashamed. Stop us from recognising or dealing with other emotions. Make it harder for us to take care of ourselves. Impact our self-esteem. Have an effect on our bodies, for example, impacting our sleep. Lead to people making judgements about us. When is anger a problem? We can all struggle to manage our anger at times. But signs that it may be becoming a problem for you include: You feel like you can't control your anger, or that it controls your life. You express your anger through unhelpful or destructive behaviour, such as violence or self-harm. You're worried your behaviour may become abusive. Your anger is having a negative effect on your relationships, work, studies or hobbies. Your anger is often hurting, frightening or upsetting the people around you. You feel unable to get on with your daily life because of your anger. You find yourself thinking about your anger all the time. You're often doing or saying things that you regret afterwards. Your anger is having a negative impact on your overall mental and physical health. Anger is becoming your go-to emotion, blocking out your ability to feel other emotions. Your anger regularly makes you feel worse about yourself or your life. You can't remember things you do or say when you're angry. You're using alcohol or drugs to cope with your anger. I internalise anger and punish myself by self-harm. We can't make our anger go away. But if you feel that your anger is becoming a problem for you, there are ways that you can try to manage it. It's important to seek treatment and support, especially if you're worried your anger may put you or others at risk. My brain goes blank and I absent-mindedly release my anger through physical violence towards myself or objects around me. I don't realise how destructive I've been until immediately afterwards."
"What does anger feel like? Anger feels different for everyone. You might experience some of the things listed below. You might also have other experiences or difficulties that aren't listed here. This page covers: Effects of anger on your body. Effects of anger on your mind. How you might act when you're angry. Anger and stigma. Effects of anger on your body. An uncomfortable or churning feeling in your stomach. Tightness in your chest. An increased and rapid heartbeat. Your legs go weak. Tense muscles. You feel hot. You have an urge to go to the toilet. Sweating. Headaches or tension in your head or eyes. Shaking or trembling. Dizziness. Grinding your teeth. Effects of anger on your mind. You might feel: Tense, nervous or unable to relax. Guilty. Resentful towards other people or situations. Easily irritated. Overwhelmed. Like you can't control yourself. Like a 'red mist' is coming over you or you're 'seeing red'. Humiliated. It feels like there's a ball of fire in the middle of my chest that blurts its way straight out of my mouth and burns the people around me. How you might act when you're angry. How you act when you're angry can depend on how you identify and cope with your feelings. And how you've learned to express them.  Not everyone expresses anger in the same way. For example, some ways you may have learned to express anger include: Outward aggression – such as shouting, swearing, slamming doors, hitting or throwing things, being physically violent, threatening others, or being verbally abusive. Inward aggression – such as telling yourself that you hate yourself, denying yourself basic needs (like food or sleep), avoiding things that might make you happy, isolating yourself from others or self-harming. Non-violent or passive aggression – such as ignoring people, refusing to speak to them, suggesting you might leave or do something to hurt yourself, refusing to do tasks or deliberately doing them poorly or late, or saying sarcastic or indirectly unkind things. Recognising these signs may give you a chance to think about how you want to react to a situation before doing or saying anything. This can be very difficult in the heat of the moment. But the earlier you notice how you're feeling, the easier it may be to manage your anger. I could recognise the signs. Behaving aggressively and then feeling guilty and shameful about it afterwards. Anger and stigma. We all express our emotions differently. This can be impacted by our culture, our personality, how we were brought up and many other things. Some people struggle to understand when others express their emotions in a different way to them. Because of this, we may sometimes feel judged about the way we express our anger. Or people may assume we're angry when we're not. Society has some strong ideas when it comes to expressing emotions; you have to behave in a certain way. There are also lots of negative stereotypes around anger. Some of us may be judged more harshly for our anger than others. This could be due to racism, sexism or other forms of discrimination or bias. Because of this, you may feel like you need to suppress your own feelings of anger or hurt. Or you may worry that you'll be blamed or judged if you express your feelings, when others wouldn't be. This can be very frustrating and upsetting, especially if impacts our daily lives, jobs or relationships. Or if it means that we feel like we have to accept being mistreated. But it's important to remember that you deserve support and respect. And that your feelings are valid. I was often made to feel as if I was the problem and told that I needed to control my anger when I was simply just trying to address how I was feeling."
"Why do I get angry? We can feel angry for many different reasons. It might be because of a difficult situation we're experiencing. Or something that happened to us in the past. Sometimes, we might feel anger because of how we interpret and react to certain situations. People can interpret situations differently. Something that makes you feel very angry may not make someone else feel angry at all. But just because we can interpret things differently, it doesn't mean that you're interpreting things 'wrong' if you get angry. How and when you feel angry, and how you react to anger, can depend on lots of factors in your life, including your: Childhood and upbringing. Past experiences. Current circumstances. Health and wellbeing. Whether your anger is about something that happened in the past or something happening now, thinking about how and why we interpret and react to situations can help. We can learn how to cope with our emotions better and find ways to manage our anger.  Childhood and upbringing. How we learn to cope with angry feelings is often influenced by our upbringing. Many people are given messages about anger as children. These messages may make it harder to manage anger as an adult. For example: You may have grown up thinking that it's always okay to act out your anger aggressively or violently. So you didn't learn how to understand and manage your angry feelings. This could mean you have angry outbursts whenever you don't like the way someone is behaving. Or whenever you're in a situation you don't like. You may have been brought up to believe that you shouldn't complain. You may have been punished for expressing anger as a child. This could mean that you tend to suppress your anger. If you don't feel you can release your anger in a healthy way, it can become a long-term problem. If you're not comfortable with new situations, your reaction to them might be out of place or ill-fitting. Or you might turn this anger inwards on yourself. You may have witnessed your parents' or other adults' anger when it was out of control. And learned to think of anger as something that is always destructive and terrifying. This could mean that you now feel afraid of your own anger. And you don't feel safe expressing your feelings when something makes you angry. Those feelings might then surface at another unconnected time. This may feel hard to explain. Past experiences. Sometimes the anger we're feeling right now can be related to our past experiences. This might mean that we react more strongly to a situation we're experiencing in the present, because of our anger about what happened to us in the past. If you've experienced situations in the past that made you feel angry, you might still be coping with those angry feelings now. Especially if you weren't able to safely express your anger at the time. Those situations could include abuse , trauma , racism or bullying (either as a child or more recently as an adult). This might mean that you now find some situations very difficult, and more likely to make you angry. Becoming aware of this can help us to find ways of responding to current circumstances in a safer or more helpful way. Current circumstances. We might feel angry about things that are going on in our lives right now. Or our current circumstances might make it harder to cope with or manage our emotions. There may be situations that make you feel angry, but you struggle to express or resolve your anger at the time. So you might find that you express your anger at other times. Some experiences that may be difficult include: Stress. If you're dealing with a lot of other problems in your life right now, you might find yourself feeling angry more easily than usual. Or you might get angry at unrelated things. Our pages on stress have more information. Bereavement. Anger can be a part of grief. If you've lost someone important to you, it can be hugely difficult to cope with all the conflicting things you might be feeling. Our pages on bereavement have more information. Cruse Bereavement Support can also offer support and information if you've experienced a bereavement. Discrimination or injustice, such as experiences of racism, can make us feel angry. Particularly if you're being treated unfairly, if you feel powerless to do anything about it, or if people around you don't understand. We have information that may help if you experience discrimination based on your race or ethnicity, or your sexual or gender identity. Upsetting or worrying events. We might feel angry about things that are happening in the world right now. We may see things going on which we know aren't right but that we feel powerless to stop. Or we may feel angry at the decisions made by people in power, or by the attitudes of others about issues that matter to us. Our pages on coping with distressing events in the news have more information. After a year and a half of lockdowns…Our house was so pressured, it was not a good environment. Health and wellbeing. Our physical and mental health can impact how we feel, and how we manage our emotions. This can include: Hormones. Changes in our hormones can have a big effect on our moods and emotions. This can include feeling anger which is stronger than normal, occurs in cycles, or is more difficult to control or understand. You may struggle with anger in the lead up to, during or after the menopause. Or you may notice links between your anger and your periods, or any contraception that affects your hormones. Physical pain. Ongoing or chronic pain can make us feel angry, especially if we don't get the support we need or feel we've been treated unfairly. Mental health problems. Some mental health problems may make us experience higher levels of anger. Or make it harder to manage difficult feelings. Our A-Z of mental health has more information on different mental health problems and experiences. General wellbeing. Things such as sleep, food and exercise can have a big impact on our moods, including our anger levels. I tracked my symptoms over three months, and saw that there was a direct correlation between my monthly cycle and my mental health."
"What can I do to manage my anger? It can be frightening when your anger overwhelms you. And it can be very difficult to manage it in the moment. But there are a few things you can try. Remember : If your anger can be violent or abusive, this can cause serious problems in your life and relationships. It can be very damaging to the people around you. In this case, it's essential to seek professional treatment and support for your anger. Managing anger in the moment. If we're really angry, it can be very difficult to calm down in the moment. It may help to try to delay your reaction for as long as possible. Allowing some time between when you first feel angry and when you react may help you feel calmer or more in control. Here's some things you can try: Think to yourself 'I’m feeling really angry right now' without trying to justify it or understand why. Accepting the feeling without trying to explain it can sometimes be helpful. Take yourself out of the situation. You could go for a walk, go to a different room or log off if the situation is online. Use a code word for when you feel angry. You could say this to others or to yourself to signal that you need some time to yourself before talking any further. This may help you avoid having to explain yourself in the moment. Focus on what's around you. Try listing 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. Focus on your breath. Breathe slowly and deeply. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Some people find it helpful to count while doing this. Use a grounding object. Keep a small object with you to hold and focus on when you feel angry. For example, you could use a marble, a fidget toy or a piece of fabric. Keep notes on your phone with reminders to yourself about what to do when you feel angry. What helps me is getting away from the situation to cool down Try some ways to distract or calm yourself. If possible, try to do something to distract yourself for a while before trying to deal with the situation that made you feel angry. Doing something to distract yourself mentally or physically can help stop your anger escalating. It could be anything that completely changes your situation, thoughts or patterns. Not all of these tips work for everyone. You may need to experiment and try different things until you find what works for you. Relax your body. If you can feel your body getting tense, try focusing on each part of your body in turn to tense and then relax your muscles.  Try mindfulness techniques. Mindfulness can help you to be aware of when you're getting angry. And it can help calm your body and mind.  Try to avoid rumination. Rumination is when we think about an issue or problem over and over again in our head. For example, you may be thinking of all the reasons why you feel angry. This can be unhelpful in the moment, as it may make you feel more distressed or worked up. Try to remember that you don’t need to 'solve' or justify your anger. And you can distract yourself for now and then come back to the issue once you feel more in control. Take a cold shower. Or try running cold water on your hands and face. Talk to a trusted person who's not connected to the situation. This could be a friend, family member, counsellor or peer support group. Expressing your thoughts out loud may help you understand why you're angry and help calm you. If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone you know, you can call the Samaritans. The helpline is confidential, open 24 hours a day and you can talk about anything that's upsetting you. Our useful contacts page lists other organisations that can also help. Use up your energy safely in other ways. This can help relieve some of your angry feelings in a way that doesn't hurt you or others. For example, you could try tearing up paper, hitting a pillow or smashing ice cubes. Do some physical activity. It may help to work off your anger through exercise or other physical activity. Sports like running or boxing can be helpful for releasing pent up energy. Or putting on upbeat music and dancing. Do something with your hands, like fixing or making something. Or something creative like drawing or colouring. Express your anger through writing or art. For example, you could write all of your feelings down in a journal or record them to yourself on your phone. This may help you get those feelings out of your head. Some people find it helpful to do this and then rip up or delete the notes afterwards. Spend time in green space or bring nature into your everyday life. This can reduce stress or anger and help you feel more relaxed.  Dealing with one problem at a time has helped. I keep a diary in which I write my thoughts, this helps me process things and usually I feel better after jotting them down. Exercise and music are another great coping mechanism. I love going to the gym and lifting weights. Remember : Learning new techniques to help manage your feelings can take time and practice. Try to be patient and gentle with yourself as you learn these new skills."
"How can I manage my anger long term? If you think about how to manage your anger when you're feeling calmer, you can avoid feeling overwhelmed by it in the heat of the moment. This page covers some of the things you can do: Look out for warning signs. Learn your triggers. Examine your thought patterns. Develop your communication skills. Look at your lifestyle. Take action. Look out for warning signs. Anger can cause a rush of adrenaline through your body. So before you recognise the emotion you're feeling you might notice: Your heart is beating faster. Your breathing is quicker. Your body is becoming tense. You're clenching your jaw or fists. Learning to recognise these signs may help you think about how you want to react to a situation before you do anything. This can be difficult in the heat of the moment. But the earlier you notice how you're feeling, the easier it may be to choose how to manage your anger. Breathing techniques have helped me to control my anger. I know that if I take a moment to concentrate on my breathing and not my anger, I'll have something else to focus on. Learn your triggers. Understanding what sort of situations trigger your anger can help. You may be able to develop ways to cope and think about how to react before the situation happens. You might find it helpful to keep a diary or make notes about the times you've felt angry. You could record: What were the circumstances? Did someone say or do something to trigger your anger? How did you feel? How did you act? How did you feel afterwards? If you do this for a while, you might start to see patterns emerging. You could do this yourself using a mood diary. Many are available online for free. You could also ask a professional therapist to support you to understand your triggers.  Over time I have been able to spot certain triggers, which then enables me to look at myself and choose a healthier path. Examine your thought patterns. If you're feeling upset or angry, you might find yourself automatically thinking or saying things like: ""This is all their fault."". ""They never listen."". ""This always happens to me."". ""Other people should behave better."". It can make you feel worse if you think in terms of 'always', 'never' and 'should'. In reality things are rarely so black and white. Trying to replace these words with softer terms like 'sometimes' or 'could' when thinking about your situation might help you. They could break up negative thought patterns, help you to reflect more calmly on your situation and find new ways through conflicts. When you're feeling angry, it may also help to try to name any emotions you experience. There may be several. Without justifying or explaining, try to acknowledge and accept them. For example, you may say, ""I feel angry, rejected and scared right now"". You can do this out loud, in your head or write it down. Accepting our emotions for what they are can sometimes be a helpful first step in being able to manage them. The best advice I was given was to stop briefly once I am angry to ask myself what painful emotion I am feeling in the situation where I became angry. A bit of compassion for my own pain often stops me from taking that pain out on others. Develop your communication skills. Our anger can sometimes get in the way of communicating our feelings and thoughts effectively. People may focus on our anger and find it hard to listen to what we're saying. If you can express your anger by talking in an assertive, respectful way about what has made you angry, then you may be more likely to be listened to or understood by others. Being assertive means standing up for yourself while still respecting other people and their opinions. It can: Make communication easier. Stop tense situations getting out of control. Benefit your relationships and self-esteem. Learning to be assertive might not feel easy to start with, but here are some things to try: Think about the outcome you want to achieve. What's making you angry, and what do you want to change? Is it enough just to explain what you're angry about? Be specific. For example, you could open your statement with, ""I feel angry with you because..."" Using the phrase 'I feel' avoids blaming anyone and the other person is less likely to feel attacked. Really listen to the other person's response and try to understand their point of view. Keep practising. Try not to worry if the conversation doesn’t always go the way you hoped it would. If you feel yourself getting angry, you might want to come back to the conversation another time. The organisation MindTools provides tips on respectful assertiveness on its website. What helps me is acknowledging how I'm feeling and why, then taking time to address it productively. Look at your lifestyle. Looking after your wellbeing more generally could help you feel calmer and more in control when things happen that make you feel angry. You might want to: Think about how you use drugs and alcohol. Although you might feel this could help you cope in the short term, alcohol and drugs can affect our ability to control our emotions and actions. They can also be a factor in violence. For information and support on reducing or stopping the use of drugs or alcohol, you can contact Turning Point or Alcoholics Anonymous.  Try to get active. Being physically active can help let out any tension you're feeling. It can also have benefits to your self-esteem. Even gentle exercise like going for a walk can make a difference.  Try to get good sleep. Not sleeping well can have a huge impact on how we're feeling, and how well we cope with things that happen to us.  Think about what you eat and drink.  Find ways to manage stress. We can feel pressured or stressed for lots of different reasons. Taking some time to learn how to deal with pressure can help us feel more in control of difficult situations.  Take care online. There's lots on the internet that may make us feel angry or distressed. It can be hard to avoid. And sometimes we might look at this content more than we'd like, or get into arguments with others online. It could help to take breaks from the internet. Or change the accounts you follow or websites you visit. Our pages on online mental health have more information. Exercise is the best thing to manage my anger. It transforms my mood! Take action. Sometimes our anger can be caused by problems within our communities or our wider society. This can make us feel powerless or frustrated. But sometimes anger can be a helpful tool. You could try and direct your anger into working for positive change. It can be hard to know where to start but things to think about include: Mind campaigns. Visit our campaigns page to find out how we're campaigning for change, and how to get involved. Community groups. There might be campaigns or volunteering projects to improve your local area and community. Do IT has information on volunteer groups in your area. Other charities or campaign groups. There are many charities or groups trying to make a difference to the world. You may be able to get involved with their work or support them. This could be through fundraising, campaigning, signing petitions or supporting them on social media. Take part in local decisions. Your area may have regular meetings of local, parish or town councils. You can often attend these meetings to have a say in decisions affecting your community. The UK Government website has a search tool to find your local council. Write to your MP. You can contact your local member of parliament (MP) to tell them about a problem in your area and ask them to take action. The UK Parliament website has information on how to contact an MP. Share your story. Sharing your experiences with others can be a powerful way to help others or to create change. You could do this through peer support groups or you could share your experiences online. Raising the issues with the local council, and focusing my anger into good things. This helped me feel a sense of community, and allowed me to direct my anger away from harm, and towards something positive."

It felt good to be able to comfortably explain where I am coming from and what triggered my anger, without worrying about being judged. Talking therapies and counselling. Talking therapies and counselling involve talking about your problems with a trained professional, such as a counsellor or psychotherapist. They can help you explore the causes of your anger and ways to manage it. This may help you understand your feelings and improve your responses to situations that make you angry. There are different types of talking therapies which might be able to help you cope with or manage your anger. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is highly structured short-term talking therapy. It examines how your thoughts, feelings and behaviours affect each other. It also aims to teach you practical skills to change this. CBT is the most commonly offered talking therapy on the NHS. You could also try to learn CBT techniques by yourself using self-help books from your local library, or free, online apps. Counselling is a treatment where you might talk through a specific issue. For example, outbursts of anger with your partner or in the workplace. And try to understand how you could manage those situations differently. Psychodynamic therapy often lasts longer than counselling and tends to go deeper into past experiences. Your focus here may be on learning more about yourself to help you understand why you express your anger the way you do. Or why certain situations make you angry.

You can also see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem for tips on how to talk to your doctor about your mental health. Anger when trying to seek support Accessing treatment and support can be challenging. You might experience setbacks or delays.

"What can friends and family do? This page is for friends and family of someone who is experiencing problems with anger. This page covers: How can I support someone who is experiencing anger? What if their behaviour is abusive or violent? What if they don't recognise they have a problem? How can I support someone who is experiencing anger? It can be very difficult when someone you care about is experiencing problems with anger. Especially if they sometimes direct their anger towards you, others close to them, or themselves. We're all responsible for our own actions. Ultimately it will be up to them to learn how to manage and express their anger appropriately. But there are still lots of things you can do to help support them: Stay calm. Although you probably have a lot of difficult feelings of your own, if you can stay calm it can help to stop anger escalating. Try to listen to them. If you can, allow them time to communicate their feelings without judging them. Often when someone feels that they're being listened to, they are more able to hear other people's points of view as well. And sometimes just being given permission to communicate angry feelings can be enough to help someone calm down. Give them space. If you notice that continuing the conversation is making it worse, give them space to calm down and think. This could be something like going into another room for a while, or spending a few days apart. It's important to give yourself space as well, so you don't find yourself getting too angry. Set boundaries. While there are lots of reasons why this can be difficult, it's important to set limits and boundaries. Be clear in advance about what sort of behaviour is and isn't acceptable to you. And think about what action you can take if someone crosses the line. You don't have to put up with any behaviour that makes you feel unsafe or seriously affects your own wellbeing. Help them identify their triggers. This is something you can try when you're both feeling calm, away from any heated situation. Identifying someone's triggers for anger can help you both think about ways you can avoid triggering situations. And you can plan how to handle them and how to communicate when they do arise. But try not to be judgemental, or accusatory. It can be useful to give specific examples of when you remember them getting angry. But be aware that this is probably upsetting for them to think about. Support them to seek professional help. For example, you could help them arrange to see their GP, or help research anger management courses.  Look after your own wellbeing. It can be difficult at times to support someone else, so make sure you're looking after your own wellbeing too. See our information on how to cope when supporting someone else for more on this. The worst thing is for people to tell me to calm down or say that whatever caused my anger doesn't matter. People listening and accepting my feelings (even if my anger seems unprecedented) helps the most. What if their behaviour is abusive or violent? Just because someone seems very angry, it doesn't necessarily mean that they will become violent or abusive. The NHS pages on abuse have some information on how to recognise the signs of abuse and seek support. But if someone does become violent or abusive, the most important thing is to make sure that you're safe. Don't confront someone who is behaving aggressively. If you want to talk to them, wait until the situation has calmed down. You may want to make a safety plan.

"What is anxiety? Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. Anxiety is a natural human response when we feel that we are under threat. It can be experienced through our thoughts, feelings and physical sensations. For me, anxiety feels as if everyone in the world is waiting for me to trip up, so that they can laugh at me. It makes me feel nervous and unsure whether the next step I take is the best way forward. Most people feel anxious at times. It's particularly common to experience some anxiety while coping with stressful events or changes, especially if they could have a big impact on your life.  If you are feeling anxious or experiencing a panic attack right now, see our page on how to manage panic attacks . What is the 'fight, flight or freeze' response? Like all animals, human beings have evolved ways to help us protect ourselves from danger. When we feel under threat our bodies react by releasing certain hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can be helpful. These hormones: make us feel more alert, so we can act faster. make our hearts beat faster, quickly sending blood to where it's needed most. After we feel the threat has passed, our bodies release other hormones to help our muscles relax. This can sometimes cause us to shake. This is commonly called the 'fight, flight or freeze' response – it's something that happens automatically in our bodies, and we have no control over it. Going out of the house is a challenge because I have a fear of panicking and feel that I'm being watched or judged. It's just horrible. I want to get help but I'm afraid of being judged. When is anxiety a mental health problem? Anxiety can become a mental health problem if it impacts your ability to live your life as fully as you want to. For example, it may be a problem if: your feelings of anxiety are very strong or last for a long time. your fears or worries are out of proportion to the situation. you avoid situations that might cause you to feel anxious. your worries feel very distressing or are hard to control. you regularly experience symptoms of anxiety, which could include panic attacks. you find it hard to go about your everyday life or do things you enjoy. If your symptoms fit a particular set of medical criteria then you might be diagnosed with a particular anxiety disorder . But it's also possible to experience problems with anxiety without having a specific diagnosis. Our pages on self-care and treatment for anxiety offer suggestions for help and support. You know that feeling when you're rocking on the back legs of your chair and suddenly for a split second you think you're about to fall; that feeling in your chest? Imagine that split second feeling being frozen in time and lodged in your chest for hours/days, and imagine with it that sense of dread sticking around too, but sometimes you don't even know why."
"What are anxiety disorders? Anxiety can be experienced in lots of different ways. If your experiences meet certain criteria your doctor might diagnose you with a specific anxiety disorder. Some commonly diagnosed anxiety disorders are: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) – this means having regular or uncontrollable worries about many different things in your everyday life. Because there are lots of possible symptoms of anxiety this can be quite a broad diagnosis, meaning that the problems you experience with GAD might be quite different from another person's experiences. Social anxiety disorder – this diagnosis means you experience extreme fear or anxiety triggered by social situations (such as parties, workplaces, or everyday situations where you have to talk to another person). It is also known as social phobia.  Panic disorder – this means having regular or frequent panic attacks without a clear cause or trigger. Experiencing panic disorder can mean that you feel constantly afraid of having another panic attack, to the point that this fear itself can trigger your panic attacks.  Phobias – a phobia is an extreme fear or anxiety triggered by a particular situation (such as going outside) or a particular object (such as spiders).  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – this is a diagnosis you may be given if you develop anxiety problems after going through something you found traumatic. PTSD can involve experiencing flashbacks or nightmares which can feel like you're re-living all the fear and anxiety you experienced at the time of the traumatic events.  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) – you may be given this diagnosis if your anxiety problems involve having repetitive thoughts, behaviours or urges.  Health anxiety – this means you experience obsessions and compulsions relating to illness, including researching symptoms or checking to see if you have them. It is related to OCD. You can find out more about health anxiety on the Anxiety UK website. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) – this means you experience obsessions and compulsions relating to your physical appearance.  Perinatal anxiety or perinatal OCD – some people develop anxiety problems during pregnancy or in the first year after giving birth.  You might not have, or want, a diagnosis of a particular anxiety disorder – but it might still be useful to learn more about these different diagnoses to help you think about your own experiences of anxiety, and consider options for support. Living with GAD & panic attacks after losing my Dad. I really believe that talking is one of the best therapies you can have. Read Zoe's story It's like a swarm of bees just buzzing buzzing buzzing, not stopping, making it impossible to focus and seemingly impossible to slow down and take a breath. Anxiety and other mental health problems. It's very common to experience anxiety alongside other mental health problems , such as depression or suicidal feelings . If you have symptoms of both anxiety and depression but don't fit one more clearly than the other, you might be given a diagnosis of 'mixed anxiety and depressive disorder'. I thought anxiety would be my biggest challenge... I was wrong. I felt fine. I always feel fine when I'm up. That's a part of the problem. I have generalised anxiety disorder and depression which seem to come in cycles. It is the unexpected attacks that I find the hardest."

Anxiety and physical health problems Some studies suggest that experiencing anxiety could increase the risk of developing certain long-term physical health problems, including diabetes, stomach ulcers and heart problems. But there's not enough evidence to say for sure exactly what the risks are, or what groups of people are most likely to be affected. Having a physical illness or disability can also make you feel stressed and anxious, so it might sometimes feel like your anxiety problems and physical health problems are part of a vicious circle. Sometimes it might be difficult to work out whether your symptoms are totally related to anxiety, or might be related to a different illness. If you're experiencing any physical symptoms it's best to talk to your GP, so they can check out what may be causing them.

"What is a panic attack? Panic attacks are a type of fear response. They're an exaggeration of your body's normal response to danger, stress or excitement. This page covers: What do panic attacks feel like? When might I have panic attacks? What helps to manage panic attacks? What is panic disorder? What do panic attacks feel like? During a panic attack, physical symptoms can build up very quickly. These can include: a pounding or racing heartbeat. feeling faint, dizzy or light-headed. feeling very hot or very cold. sweating, trembling or shaking. nausea (feeling sick). pain in your chest or abdomen. struggling to breathe or feeling like you're choking. feeling like your legs are shaky or are turning to jelly. feeling disconnected from your mind, body or surroundings, which are types of dissociation. During a panic attack you might feel very afraid that you're: losing control. going to faint. having a heart attack. going to die. My teeth would chatter uncontrollably and my whole body would tremble, I'd hyperventilate and cry with panic as the feeling that I was going to fall unconscious was so convincing. Panic attacks – I turned my mental health crisis into a mental health triumph. Although it's taken me a long time I have learned I am a strong person who has the potential to help others. Read Abby's story You might find that you become scared of going out alone or to public places because you're worried about having another panic attack. If this fear becomes very intense, it may be called agoraphobia.  I felt like I couldn't breathe, I just wanted to get out, to go somewhere else, but I couldn't because I was on a train. When might I have panic attacks? Panic attacks happen at different times for everyone. Some people have one panic attack then don't ever experience another, or you might find that you have them regularly, or several in a short space of time. You might notice that particular places, situations or activities seem to trigger panic attacks. For example, they might happen before a stressful appointment. Most panic attacks last between 5 to 20 minutes. They can come on very quickly. Your symptoms will usually be at their worst within 10 minutes. You might also experience symptoms of a panic attack over a longer period of time. This could be because you're having a second panic attack, or you're experiencing other symptoms of anxiety . My panic attacks seem to come out of the blue now. But in fact, they seem to be triggered mainly at night when I want to go to sleep but cannot stop my mind racing, experiencing worry and panic about anything that may be on my mind.

It could help to print off these tips, or write them down, and keep them somewhere easy to find. During a panic attack: Focus on your breathing. It can help to concentrate on breathing slowly in and out while counting to five. Stamp on the spot. Some people find this helps control their breathing. Focus on your senses. For example, taste mint-flavoured sweets or gum, or touch or cuddle something soft. Try grounding techniques. Grounding techniques can help you feel more in control. They're especially useful if you experience dissociation during panic attacks.  After a panic attack: Think about self-care. It's important to pay attention to what your body needs after you've had a panic attack. For example, you might need to rest somewhere quietly, or eat or drink something. Tell someone you trust. If you feel able to, it could help to let someone know you've had a panic attack. It could be particularly helpful to mention how they might notice if you're having another one, and how you'd like them to help you.  Coping with panic attacks. I began to avoid assemblies, going to class and going out with friends. Read Hannah's story What is panic disorder?

It's common to experience panic disorder and certain types of phobia together. People who experience panic disorder may have some periods with few or no panic attacks, but have lots at other times. Panic disorder and high sensitivity Some research suggests that people who have panic disorder might be very sensitive to sensory experiences (such as sunlight, smells and changes in the weather), but there's not enough evidence yet to say for sure. Also it's not clear whether having a high level of sensitivity to these sorts of things is something that might cause you to develop panic disorder, or whether it may be an effect of having it. Never knowing when I was going to have a panic attack was the worst feeling in the world."
"What causes anxiety? Everyone's experience of anxiety is different, so it's hard to know exactly what causes anxiety problems. There are probably lots of factors involved. This page covers some things which make anxiety problems more likely to happen: past or childhood experiences. your current life situation. physical and mental health problems. drugs and medication. Can anxiety problems be inherited genetically? Research shows that having a close relative with anxiety problems might increase your chances of experiencing anxiety problems yourself. This is sometimes called 'anxiety sensitivity'. At the moment there is not enough evidence to show whether this is because we share some genes that make us more vulnerable to developing anxiety, or because we learn particular ways of thinking and behaving from our parents and other family members as we grow up. Past or childhood experiences. Difficult experiences in childhood, adolescence or adulthood are a common trigger for anxiety problems. Going through stress and trauma when you're very young is likely to have a particularly big impact. Experiences which can trigger anxiety problems include things like: physical or emotional abuse. neglect. losing a parent. being bullied or being socially excluded. experiencing racism. Having parents who don't treat you warmly or are overprotective can also be a factor. I was sent to boarding school and suffered acute separation anxiety, being away from home, and my brother nearly died when I was 12. My mum had an acute breakdown for a period of about a year and had to be home-nursed. Your current life situation. Current problems in your life can also trigger anxiety. For example: exhaustion or a build-up of stress. lots of change or uncertainty. feeling under pressure while studying or in work. long working hours. being out of work. money problems. housing problems and homelessness. worrying about the environment or natural disasters (sometimes called climate anxiety or eco-anxiety). losing someone close to you (sometimes called bereavement). feeling lonely or isolated. being abused, bullied or harassed, including experiencing racism. Big changes to your day-to-day life can be a particular trigger for anxiety, so you may find that you've experienced anxiety problems during the coronavirus pandemic. For information on how coronavirus may have affected your mental health and what could help see our coronavirus and mental health pages. I have recently realised that I spend money when anxious, which in turn makes me feel anxious about how much I'm spending. Physical or mental health problems. Other health problems can sometimes cause anxiety, or might make it worse. For example: Physical health problems – living with a serious, ongoing or life-threatening physical health condition can sometimes trigger anxiety. Other mental health problems – it's also common to develop anxiety while living with other mental health problems, such as depression. Drugs and medication. Anxiety can sometimes be a side effect of taking: some psychiatric medications. some medications for physical health problems. recreational drugs and alcohol. To report medication side effects see the government's Yellow Card website . Could diet be a factor? Some types of food or drink can trigger symptoms of anxiety or panic, or make them worse. These include sugar and caffeine.  I had cut out alcohol. Many think drinking alcohol helps with anxiety, but it actually makes it worse in the long run.

"What treatments are available? There are various evidence-based treatments that have been found to help with anxiety and panic disorder. This page covers: Self-help resources. Talking therapies. Medication. How do I access treatment? What if I don't feel better? Self-help resources. A self-help resource might be the first treatment option your GP offers you. This is because it's available quite quickly, and there's a chance it could help you to feel better without needing to try other options. Self-help could be delivered through: Workbooks. For example, your GP might recommend particular titles from a scheme called Reading Well, which offers Books on Prescription. This scheme is supported by most local libraries, so you can go and check the books out for free – you don't actually need a prescription from a doctor. Online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programmes. There are several online CBT courses to treat anxiety and panic attacks.  I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, depression and OCD traits. I had CBT for almost a year, which was very helpful. Talking therapies. If self-help resources aren't likely to help with the anxiety problems you're experiencing, or you've already tried them and they haven't helped, your doctor should offer you a talking treatment. There are two types of talking treatment recommended for anxiety and panic: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – this focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behaviour, and teaches you coping skills for dealing with different problems. Applied relaxation therapy – this involves learning how to relax your muscles in situations where you normally experience anxiety.  How CBT helped me beat the bully in my head. I'm no longer over-analysing every small thing that happens. Read Sarah's story Medication. Your doctor might offer to prescribe you medication to help manage your symptoms. Some people find it helpful to try talking therapies and medication at the same time, but medication shouldn't be the only thing you're offered. Here are some medications you might be offered: Antidepressants Usually this will be a type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . For some people SSRIs can cause side effects, such as sleep problems or feeling more anxious than you did before. If they don't work, or aren't right for you, you may be offered a different kind.  Pregabalin In some cases, such as if you have a diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), your doctor may decide to prescribe you a drug called pregabalin. This is an antiseizure drug which is normally used to treat epilepsy, a neurological disorder that can cause seizures, but is also licensed to treat anxiety.  Beta-blockers Beta-blockers are sometimes used to treat the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a rapid heartbeat, palpitations and tremors (shaking). But they are not psychiatric drugs so they don't reduce any of the psychological symptoms. They may be helpful in certain situations that trigger your phobia.  Benzodiazepine tranquillisers If you experience very severe anxiety that is having a significant impact on your day-to-day life, you may be offered a benzodiazepine tranquilliser. But these drugs can cause unpleasant side effects and can become addictive, so your doctor should only prescribe them at a low dose for a short time, to help you through a crisis period.  Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.  Our pages on coming off medication give guidance on how to come off medication safely. I take medication and this helps, but I have also had online therapy which was invaluable, and cognitive analytic therapy as an outpatient at a psychiatric hospital. Talking cures are fantastic. How do I access treatment? To get treatment on the NHS, the first step is normally to visit your GP. They will do an assessment, which might include asking you to fill in a questionnaire about how often you feel worried, anxious and nervous. They should then explain your treatment options to you, and you can decide together what might suit you best.  Unfortunately NHS waiting lists for talking treatments can be very long. If you're finding it hard to access talking therapies you could consider: Charities and specialist organisations. See useful contacts for a list of organisations that may offer therapy or be able to put you in touch with local services. Mind's Infoline could also help you find services near you. Private therapy. Finding a private therapist is another option some people choose to explore, but it's not suitable for everyone because it can be expensive.  What if my anxiety stops me from seeking help? It can be especially hard to get treatment if making or attending an appointment with your doctor involves doing something that causes lots of anxiety for you. For example, you might not feel able to talk on the phone or leave the house. Here are some things you could try: Ask your doctor if they offer home visits or telephone assessments. If not, they might be able to book you an appointment at a time when the surgery tends to be quiet. Some GP practices will allow someone else to ring up and book appointments for you (with your consent). It could also help to have someone come with you to the appointment for support. Depending on what's available in your area, you may be able to refer yourself for talking therapy through the NHS talking therapies service. Some services are delivered online or over the phone. You can search for talking therapies services on the NHS website. See the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)'s guidelines for treating anxiety disorders for more detailed information. If you don't know what's wrong with you, how do you know how to fix it? For me, being diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder came as a relief! It meant I wasn't imagining the awful symptoms I'd been experiencing. What if I don't feel better? Your doctor should offer you regular appointments to check how you're doing, and see how well any treatment is working for you. Different things work for different people, so if a particular medication, type of talking therapy or particular therapist doesn't work for you, your doctor should offer an alternative. If you've tried a range of treatments and none of them have helped, your doctor might refer you to a community mental health team (CMHT) . This is made up of a number of different healthcare professionals, such as psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. Your CMHT can assess you separately and offer you a personalised treatment plan. This is particularly recommended if: your symptoms are making it very difficult to carry out everyday activities. you have a serious physical health problem or another mental health problem. you're having thoughts of self-harm or suicide. It's important to remember that recovery is a journey, and it won't always be straightforward. For example, you might find it more helpful to focus on learning more about yourself and developing ways to cope, rather than trying to get rid of all your symptoms. "
"How can other people help? This page is for friends and family wanting to support someone who experiences anxiety or panic attacks. It can be really difficult when someone you care about is experiencing anxiety or panic attacks, but there are things you can do to help. Here are some tips: Don't pressure them. Try not to put pressure on your friend or family member to do more than they feel comfortable with. It's really important to be patient, listen to their wishes and take things at a pace that feels okay for them. It's understandable to want to help them face their fears or find practical solutions, but it can be very distressing for someone to feel they're being forced into situations before they feel ready. This could even make their anxiety worse. Try to remember that being unable to control their worries is part of having anxiety, and they aren't choosing how they feel. What helps me is calmness, acceptance – not trying to dispel it with 'rational' or 'logical' argument. Helping someone who is having a panic attack It's understandable to feel frightened if someone you care about experiences a panic attack – especially if it seems to happen without warning. But it can help if you: try to stay calm. gently let them know that you think they might be having a panic attack and that you are there for them. encourage them to breathe slowly and deeply – it can help to do something structured or repetitive they can focus on, such as counting out loud, or asking them to watch while you gently raise your arm up and down. encourage them to stamp their feet on the spot. encourage them to sit somewhere quietly where they can focus on their breath until they feel better. You should never encourage someone to breathe into a paper bag during a panic attack. This isn't recommended and it might not be safe.  Try to understand. Find out as much as you can about anxiety. This will help you understand what they are going through. Reading personal stories of anxiety can help too. Ask about their experience. You could ask them how anxiety affects their day-to-day life, and what makes it better or worse. Listening to how they experience things could help you to empathise with how they feel. Be kind, be non-judgemental. Let us know it will pass, let us know you are there. Ask how you can help. Your friend or family member may already know how you can support them – for example, helping t hem with difficult situations, talking to them calmly or doing breathing exercises with them . By asking them what they need or how you can help, you can support them to feel more in control themselves. Knowing that there is someone around who knows what to do if they start to feel frightened or panicked could help them feel safer and calmer. Reminding me to breathe, asking me what I need. Support them to seek help. If you think your friend or family member's anxiety is becoming a problem for them, you could encourage them to seek treatment by talking to a GP or therapist. You could: Offer to help them arrange a doctor's appointment. If they are scared of leaving the house, you could suggest they ring their GP to find out if they will do home visits and telephone appointments. Offer support when they attend appointments. You could offer to go with them to their appointments and wait in the waiting room. You can also help them plan what they'd like to talk about with the doctor.  Help them seek help from a therapist.  Help them research different options for support, such as community services or peer support groups such as those run by Anxiety UK and No Panic. See our useful contacts page for more information. You could also call Mind's Infoline to find out more about local services.  Look after yourself. It can sometimes be really challenging to support someone with a mental health problem – you are not alone if you feel overwhelmed at times. It is important to remember to look after your own mental health too, so you have the energy, time and space you need to be able to help. For example: Set boundaries and don't take on too much. If you become unwell yourself you won't be able to support them or yourself in the same way. It is also important to decide what your limits are and how much you feel able to help. Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone. Talk to others about how you're feeling. You may want to be careful about how much information you share about the person you're supporting, but talking about your own feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too. Find support for yourself. The organisations in useful contacts are there to support you as well. You may find peer support or therapies are a good outlet for your feelings. For more suggestions see our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else , dealing with pressure and how to improve your mental wellbeing."

"About bipolar disorder. To give you an introduction to bipolar disorder, this page covers: What is bipolar disorder? What's it like living with bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder and stigma​. What is bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health problem that mainly affects your mood. If you have bipolar disorder, you're likely to have times where you experience: Manic or hypomanic episodes, which means feeling high. Depressive episodes, which means feeling low. Potentially some psychotic symptoms during manic or depressive episodes. You might hear these different experiences called mood episodes or states . You can read more about them in our page on bipolar moods and symptoms . Depending on the way you experience these moods, and how severely they affect you, your doctor may diagnose you with a particular type of bipolar disorder . It's an emotional amplifier: when my mood is high I feel far quicker, funnier, smarter and livelier than anyone; when my mood is low I take on the suffering of the whole world. Bipolar disorder and stigma. Many of us have heard of bipolar disorder, but this doesn't mean we all fully understand the diagnosis. You might find that some people have: Misconceptions about you. A negative or inaccurate image of bipolar disorder. This can feel very upsetting. Especially if the person who thinks this way is a friend, colleague, family member or healthcare professional. Remember you are not alone and you don't have to put up with people treating you badly. You might want to think about the following options: Show people this information. It might help them better understand what your bipolar disorder diagnosis means. Get more involved in your treatment. You can have a say in your treatment, make your voice heard, and take steps if you’re not happy with your care. For guidance, see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem. Know your rights. The law can help you in certain situations. For more information, see our pages on legal rights. Take action with Mind. For details of ways you can get involved in helping challenge stigma, see our page on campaigning. For more information , see our page o n stigma and misconceptions about mental health . What helps me the most is the ongoing realisation and acceptance that the way in which my bipolar disorder manifests itself, and the symptoms I display, are not personality traits or 'bad behaviour'. What does bipolar mean? The word bipolar has two parts: Bi meaning 'two'. Polar meaning 'completely opposite'. The term bipolar refers to the way your mood can change between two very different states – mania and depression . In the past, people used to refer to bipolar disorder as manic depression . You might still hear people use this older term today. But both terms can lead to misunderstanding. People can think it means only having mood swings between severe mania and depression. But bipolar disorder is much more complex than this. Mood episodes can range from severe depression to mania, and anything in between. Sometimes your episodes may feel intense and other times you may feel stable. And you may never experience certain mood episodes. For example, not everyone with bipolar disorder will experience mania. Some healthcare professionals may also use the term bipolar affective disorder. 'Affective' means that the disorder relates to mood or emotions. The term bipolar can be a little bit misleading actually, because I don't think there are just always two poles of being depressed and being manic."
"Bipolar moods and symptoms. We all have changes in our mood, but in bipolar disorder these changes can feel very distressing and have a big impact on your life. You may feel that your high and low moods are extreme, and that swings in your mood are overwhelming. And you may feel and behave very differently, depending on your mood. This can be difficult and confusing. These swings in mood are sometimes called mood episodes or mood states . Not everyone experiences mood episodes in the same way or for the same amount of time. This page covers: Manic and hypomanic episodes. Depressive episodes. Mixed episodes. Psychotic symptoms. Stable or neutral periods. How often do bipolar episodes occur? Manic and hypomanic episodes. Manic and hypomanic episodes – or mania and hypomania – both mean feeling high. Manic and hypomanic episodes have similarities in how they may make you feel or act. But there are some key differences: Severity of symptoms. Severe mania is very serious and often requires hospital treatment. Hypomania can noticeably change your mood or behaviour, but it's less severe than mania. Impact on your life. Manic episodes can impact your ability to do your daily activities – often disrupting or completely stopping them. Hypomanic episodes can disrupt your life, but you may still feel able to work or socialise. Length of episode. For a mood episode to be classed as mania, it needs to last for a week or more. For hypomania, it needs to last for 4 days or more. But both manic and hypomanic episodes can last much longer than this. Types of symptoms. You may be more likely to experience severe symptoms with mania, such as more extreme risk-taking behaviours. Manic episodes can sometimes include psychotic symptoms, like hallucinations or delusions. Hypomanic episodes never include these. Both mania and hypomania can be really tough to experience and manage. Whether you experience mania or hypomania, or if you're not sure what you're experiencing, it's always OK to seek support . The hardest thing to explain is the racing thoughts when I'm manic. It's like I've got four brains and they're all on overdrive... it can be scary but also euphoric at the same time. Feelings During a manic or hypomanic episode, you might feel: Happy, joyful or a sense of wellbeing. Very excited or uncontrollably excited. Like you can't get your words out fast enough. Irritable or agitated. Increased sexual energy. Easily distracted – like your thoughts are racing or you can't concentrate. Confident or adventurous. Like you’re untouchable or can't be harmed (more likely in mania). Like you can perform physical and mental tasks better than normal. Like you need less sleep than usual. Very focused or determined to complete certain tasks or projects. Behaviours During a manic or hypomanic episode, you might: Be more active than usual. Talk a lot, speak very quickly, or not make sense to other people. Be very friendly to others. Say or do things that are inappropriate and out of character. Sleep very little or not at all. Act rudely or aggressively. Misuse drugs or alcohol. Spend money excessively or in a way that is unusual for you. Lose social inhibitions. Take risks with your safety. On 'up' days I chatter nineteen to the dozen with anyone, to the point it annoys people, and I can't stay still. What will I feel like afterwards? After a manic or hypomanic episode you might: Feel very unhappy or ashamed about how you behaved. Have made commitments or taken on responsibilities that now feel unmanageable. Have only a few clear memories of what happened during your episode, or none at all. Feel very tired and need a lot of sleep and rest. For more information, see our pages on hypomania and mania . Depressive episodes. Depressive episodes are periods of feeling low. They last at least two weeks but can last much longer, sometimes for months. Like manic or hypomanic episodes, they can severely disrupt your everyday life. Severe depression may require medication or a stay in hospital. Some people find that depressive episodes can feel harder to deal with than manic or hypomanic episodes. The contrast between your high and low moods may make your depression seem even deeper. Feelings During a depressive episode, you might feel: Down, upset or tearful. Tired or sluggish. Uninterested in things you usually enjoy. Low self-esteem and a lack of confidence. Guilty, worthless or hopeless. Agitated and tense. Like you can't concentrate on anything. Suicidal. Behaviours During a depressive episode, you might: Not do things you normally enjoy. Have trouble sleeping, or sleep too much. Eat too little or too much. Misuse drugs or alcohol. Act withdrawn or avoid social situations. Spend a lot of time thinking about upsetting or difficult things (also called rumination). Avoid contacting or responding to people. Be less physically active than usual. Try to self-harm or attempt suicide. For more information, see our pages on depression . If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. The lows can be flat and devoid of colour, or intense and torturous. Sometimes it's full of demons, and pain inside so bad that nothing physical could hurt you. Mixed episodes. A mixed episode, sometimes called a mixed state, is when you feel both high and low. You may experience symptoms of depression , plus mania or hypomania at the same time. For example, you may feel very energised and impulsive, while feeling upset or tearful. Or you may feel very agitated or irritable. You may also experience highs and lows very quickly after the other, within the same day or hour. A mixed episode can be particularly difficult to cope with, as: It can be harder to work out what you're feeling. It can be harder to identify what help you need. You might find managing your emotions harder and more exhausting. Your friends, family or doctor might struggle to know how to best support you. You may be more likely to act on suicidal thoughts and feelings. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. The mixed episodes are the worst. The most unpredictable and most dangerous ones, I find them difficult to explain. Psychotic symptoms. Not everyone with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder experiences psychosis, but some people do. It's more common during manic episodes , but can also happen during depressive episodes . These kinds of experiences can feel very real to you at the time, which may make it hard to understand other people's concerns about you. Psychotic symptoms can include: Delusions, such as paranoia. Hallucinations, such as hearing voices. For more information, see our pages on psychosis . Then with mania comes the paranoia, the shadows, the voices, the thought someone is behind me following me everywhere I go, ready to get me. Stable or neutral periods. It's common to have stable or neutral periods in between episodes. This doesn't mean that you have no emotions during this time. It means that you're not currently experiencing mania, hypomania or depression, or that you're managing your symptoms effectively. You might find you feel stable for years in between episodes. Or your periods of stability might be much shorter. Stable periods can feel like a relief. But they can also feel challenging in their own way. You may feel: Happy, calm or relieved. Worried about becoming unwell again. Embarrassed or guilty about things you did or said when you were unwell. Like you have lots to sort out or catch up on. Like you have to 'get back to normal life' straight away. That you miss elements of your life or personality from when you were unwell. Unsure about whether to continue with medication or other treatment. It's a lot harder coming to terms with being stable than I could have imagined. I've had to struggle with a 'new' identity and way of life after spending so many years thinking the ups and downs of bipolar are 'normal'. How often do bipolar episodes occur? Bipolar episodes happen at different times for different people. The frequency can depend on a lot of things, such as: Your exact bipolar disorder diagnosis. How well you're able to manage your symptoms. How you'd personally define an episode. Whether certain situations or experiences can trigger episodes. For example, you might find that sleeping very little or going through a stressful life event could trigger a manic episode. The length of mood episodes can also vary. They can last for a few weeks or much longer. What's normal for you can also change over time. These experiences can be extremely difficult to cope with while going through them. While you're feeling stable, it can be helpful to think about the future. To help you with this, see our pages on looking after yourself , treatment for bipolar disorder and planning for a crisis ."
"What types of bipolar disorder are there? Bipolar disorder is often broken down into types and subtypes. Your doctor may diagnose you with a particular type of bipolar disorder. This will depend on how you experience different bipolar moods and symptoms , and how severely they affect you. Not all medical professionals agree on how to classify or diagnose bipolar disorder. More research in this area is needed.​ You may hear several different words or phrases used to describe types of bipolar. This can be confusing and frustrating. Especially if you feel that your experiences are not being fully understood. Or if you are being told different things by different people. This page covers: Bipolar 1. Bipolar 2. Cyclothymia. Rapid cycling bipolar. Bipolar with mixed features. Bipolar with seasonal pattern. Unspecified bipolar. Bipolar 1. You may get a diagnosis of bipolar 1 if you have experienced: At least one episode of mania which has lasted longer than a week. Some depressive episodes too, although not everyone does. Bipolar 2. You may get a diagnosis of bipolar 2 if you have experienced both of the following: At least one depressive episode. Symptoms of hypomania that have lasted at least four days. Cyclothymia. You may get a diagnosis of cyclothymia if: You've experienced both hypomanic and depressive mood episodes over the course of two years or more. Your symptoms aren't severe enough to meet the diagnostic criteria of bipolar 1 or bipolar 2. Cyclothymia can sometimes develop into bipolar 1 or bipolar 2. Cyclothymia can be a difficult diagnosis to receive. You may feel as though someone is saying your symptoms are 'not serious enough', but this isn't the case. Cyclothymia can seriously impact your life. And mental health is a spectrum that covers lots of different experiences. I have cyclothymia. It can make you feel more like it must be all in your head as the symptoms are often not as extreme as bipolar. Rapid cycling bipolar. You may be told you have bipolar 1 or 2 'with rapid cycling' if you've experienced 4 or more depressive , manic or hypomanic or mixed episodes within a year. This might mean: You experience episodes of mania or hypomania, followed by episodes of depression. You feel stable for a few weeks between episodes. For example, you may cycle between manic episodes and stable periods. You experience episodes that last months, weeks or days. If you have bipolar disorder, you may experience rapid cycling at certain times in your life and not others. Currently, rapid cycling is not officially considered a separate type of bipolar disorder. More research is needed about rapid cycling and how best to treat it. For more information on rapid cycling, see the Bipolar UK website . If your mood changes quickly within the same day, or the same hour, this is usually classed as a mixed episode , rather than rapid cycling. But some people use the term rapid cycling to describe this experience. Bipolar with mixed features. You may be told that you have bipolar 1 or 2 ' with mixed features ' if you experience mixed episodes . This is when you experience depression and mania or hypomania at the same time, or very quickly after each other. This is sometimes called mixed bipolar state or mixed affective bipolar . Bipolar with seasonal pattern. You may be told that you have bipolar 1 or 2 ' with seasonal pattern'. This means that the time of year or seasons regularly affect your mood episodes . Unspecified bipolar. You may hear this if your symptoms don't quite fit into the diagnostic categories for other types of bipolar disorder. But this doesn't mean that : Your symptoms are any less difficult. You don't need treatment or support. Using any of these terms can help both you and health professionals discuss your diagnosis and treatment more specifically. If they ever use words or phrases you don't understand, you can ask them to explain."
"How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? Thi s page covers: What will my doctor ask me? How long will diagnosis take? Challenges with getting a diagnosis. What will my doctor ask me? To make a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, your doctor will ask you about: How many symptoms you experience. Which types of mood episodes you experience. How long your mood episodes last for. How many mood episodes you've had. How often your mood episodes occur. How your symptoms impact your life. Your family history. They may also: Ask you to keep a diary of your moods to help you both identify patterns and triggers. Check up on your physical health. For example, some conditions like thyroid problems can cause mania-like symptoms. Only a mental health professional like a psychiatrist can give you a bipolar disorder diagnosis – not your GP. However, if you're experiencing bipolar moods and symptoms , discussing it with your GP can be a good first step. They can refer you to a psychiatrist, who will be able to assess you. For more information see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem . Once properly diagnosed, I knew the cause. I understood that I was someone with an illness. I was not a failure, not a bad person. How long will diagnosis take? As bipolar disorder involves changes in your moods over time, your doctor may want to observe you for a while before making a diagnosis. Your doctor will want to be careful that they give you the correct diagnosis. Bipolar disorder has some symptoms in common with other mental health problems, such as: Depression. Borderline personality disorder (BPD). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Schizoaffective disorder. Schizophrenia. Because of this, it might take a long time to get a correct diagnosis – sometimes it can take years. The trouble with bipolar is that sometimes it can go undiagnosed. You don't go to the doctor to tell them you are feeling extremely happy. That you've got so much energy and can conquer the world (quite literally). If you drive, you need to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) that you have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. For more information on your right to drive, including when and how to contact the DVLA, see our legal pages on fitness to drive . Challenges with getting a diagnosis. The symptoms of bipolar disorder can overlap with other mental health problems. Different people may experience or express their symptoms in different ways. And professionals do not always get it right. Because of this, you might: Not get a diagnosis of bipolar disorder when you feel you should have one. Get a diagnosis of a different mental health problem, which you don't agree with. Get a diagnosis of bipolar disorder that you think is incorrect. Even if you think your diagnosis is correct, you may still feel that it doesn't completely fit your experiences. If you are unhappy or concerned about your diagnosis, it's important to discuss this with your doctor. You can make sure your voice is heard, seek a second opinion and take steps if you're not happy with your doctor. For more information, see our pages on: Advocacy. Seeking help for a mental health problem. Facing and overcoming barriers. I was diagnosed with BPD first because of the overlap in symptoms between bipolar 2 and BPD."
"What causes bipolar disorder? No one knows exactly what causes bipolar disorder. Research suggests that a combination of factors could increase your chance of developing it. This includes physical, environmental and social conditions. This page covers: Childhood trauma. Stressful life events. Brain chemistry. Family links. Medication, drugs and alcohol. Childhood trauma. Some experts believe that experiencing a lot of emotional distress as a child can cause bipolar disorder to develop. This could be because childhood trauma and distress can have a big effect on your ability to manage your emotions. This can include experiences like: Neglect. Sexual, physical or emotional abuse. Traumatic events. Losing someone very close to you, such as a parent or carer. Stressful life events. You may be able to link the start of your symptoms to stressful experiences or situations in your life. Some people also find that stress can trigger a mood episode . Or it may make symptoms feel more intense or difficult to manage. Things that can cause stress include: A relationship breakdown. Money worries and poverty. Experiencing trauma. Losing someone close to you. Being abused, bullied or harassed, including experiencing racism. Feeling lonely or isolated. Lots of change or uncertainty. Feeling under pressure while working, studying or looking for work. Big events, such as weddings or holidays. For more information on the links between stress and mental health, see our pages on managing stress . Doing too much, or going to extremes, in any aspect of my life, is a recipe for a mood episode. Brain chemistry. Evidence shows that you can treat bipolar symptoms with certain psychiatric medications which act on the neurotransmitters. These are the 'messenger chemicals' in your brain. This suggests that bipolar disorder may relate to functional problems of the neurotransmitters. While some research supports this, no one knows for sure how these neurotransmitters work. And we don't know whether problems with these are a cause of bipolar disorder, or a result of it. Family links. If you experience bipolar disorder, you're more likely to have a family member who also experiences bipolar moods and symptoms . But they might not have a formal diagnosis. This suggests that bipolar disorder can be passed on genetically through families. But this doesn't strictly mean that there is one 'bipolar gene'. Family links are likely to be much more complex. For example, researchers think that social factors can also trigger experiences of bipolar disorder symptoms. And family members can be an influential part of your environment as you grow up. Medication, drugs and alcohol. Medication, drugs and alcohol may cause you to experience some bipolar moods and symptoms . For example: Medication. Some medications can cause hypomania or mania as a side effect. This can happen when you're taking them, or as a withdrawal symptom when you stop taking them. This includes medications for physical conditions and psychiatric medications – including some antidepressants. Depression can also be a side effect of a lot of different medications. It's important to discuss any concerns about medication side effects with your doctor. Alcohol or recreational drugs. Using these can cause you to experience symptoms similar to mania, hypomania or depression. It can often be difficult to distinguish the effects of alcohol and drugs from mental health symptoms. Some studies suggest that using certain recreational drugs can increase your risk of developing bipolar disorder. But the evidence is very limited. If you're worried about the effects of medication, alcohol or recreational drugs on your mental health, it's important to discuss it with your doctor. For more information, see our pages on antidepressants and the mental health effects of alcohol and recreational drugs ."
"Treatment for bipolar disorder. The two main types of treatment for bipolar disorder are medication and talking therapies . The exact combination of treatments offered will depend on whether you're managing a current mood episode, or managing your mental health in the longer term. This page covers: What treatment could help me manage a current episode? What treatment could help me in a crisis? What treatment could help me in the longer term? Talking therapies for bipolar disorder. Electroconvulsive therapy for bipolar disorder.  What treatment could help me manage a current episode? Your treatment for a bipolar usually depends on what kind of episode you're experiencing. During depressive episodes : Your doctor is likely to offer you medication. This might be new medication or a change to your current bipolar medication. Your doctor might offer you a structured psychological treatment that's used to treat depression, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). During manic or hypomanic episodes : Your doctor is likely to offer you medication. This might be new medication or a change to your current bipolar medication. Your doctor is unlikely to offer a talking treatment if you’re currently experiencing a manic or hypomanic episode.  When my mood dips, CBT helps me to cope to some extent, but it doesn’t really help me get out of this state and it doesn't prevent the mood swings – that’s what my medication does. What treatment could help me in a crisis? You may need to access crisis services if: You start to feel very unwell. A mood episode is lasting for a long time. Your regular treatment isn't helping. Cr isis services may include: Emergency support, such as going to A&E. Support from a crisis resolution and home treatment (CRHT) team. Hospital admission. For more information about your options in a crisis, see our pages on crisis services . What treatment could help me in the longer term? Long-term treatment aims to help you maintain stable moods and manage your symptoms. As you start to feel more stable, most of your support could come from a community mental health team or your GP. But your GP should also put you in touch with a mental health specialist. Health professionals should work with you to help you identify: Clear emotional and social recovery goals. You can work towards these, regularly reflect on them and revise them with your doctor. A crisis plan. This helps you know what to do if you experience any of your early warning signs or triggers, or start feeling very distressed. How you feel day-to-day. It helps to be aware of how best to manage your mood and notice any changes. A medication plan. This includes dates where you can review your dose, how well the medication is working and any side effects. If you're receiving a talking therapy , you might set some of these goals with your therapist. You should share these goals with your GP. You may also want to share them with others in your life, such as your family, friends , partner or carer. It has been 13 years since I was hospitalised or sectioned, and I've done so well. My medication is working. Talking therapies for bipolar disorder. Your doctor might offer one of several talking therapies to help you manage bipolar disorder in the longer term. These could include: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Looks at how your feelings, thoughts and behaviour influence each other and how you can change these patterns. Interpersonal therapy. Focuses on your relationships with other people. Looks at how your relationships affect your thoughts, feelings and behaviour – and how they affect your relationships. Behavioural couples therapy. Focuses on recognising and trying to resolve emotional problems between partners. Individual psychoeducation. Involves a brief intervention helping you to identify triggers, spot warning signs and develop coping strategies. Group psychoeducation. Involves working in a group of people with shared experiences. Aims to build knowledge about bipolar disorder and self-management. It is led by a trained therapist. Family-focused therapy. Involves working as a family to look at behavioural traits, identify risks and build communication and problem-solving skills. Some of these treatments are more widely available than others. It can also depend on what you and your doctor agree would be most useful for you. For more information , see our pages on talking therapies . How can talking therapies help in the longer term? In the longer term, talking therapies for bipolar disorder can help you to : Understand, make sense of, or find meaning in your bipolar disorder. Reflect on the impact of bipolar disorder throughout your life. Identify early warning signs and symptoms. Develop strategies to cope with early symptoms, triggers and episodes. Make a crisis plan. Set goals and plans for staying well. In a lot of ways being so in tune with my brain is very useful; I can often spot a mood shift pretty early on which can help me try to prevent it spiralling out of control. Electroconvulsive therapy for bipolar disorder. Doctors should only consider electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment option for bipolar disorder in extreme circumstances. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare. It advises that doctors could consider ECT if you meet both of the following criteria: You're experiencing a long and severe period of depression, or a long period of mania. Other treatments have not worked, or the situation is life-threatening. If you feel like you're in this situation, you should discuss it with your doctor. They must explain ECT in a clear and accessible way before you make any decisions.  O ur pages on consent to treatment and the Mental Capacity Act 2005 also have information on treatment, consent and your rights."
"Medication for bipolar disorder. If you get a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, it's likely that your psychiatrist or GP will offer you medication. This page covers: What will my doctor need to know? Antipsychotics. Lithium. Anticonvulsants. Antidepressants. What will my doctor need to know? To help decide which medication to offer, your doctor might need to look into factors such as : Your current symptoms. For example, if you're currently experiencing a manic, hypomanic, depressive or mixed episode. Your past symptoms. Such as the types of mood episodes you have experienced, and how long they have lasted. How you've responded to treatments in the past. The risk of another episode. This could include what has triggered episodes in the past. Your physical health. In particular if you have kidney problems, weight problems or diabetes. How likely you are to stick to a medication routine. Your sex and age. In particular whether you are able to become pregnant. In older people, a test of mental processes. For example, the test used to diagnose dementia. Before you take any medication. Before you decide to take any medication, make sure you have all the facts you need to feel confident about your decision. For guidance on what you might want to know before taking any medication, see our pages on: What you should know before taking any psychiatric medication. Receiving the right medication for you. Your right to refuse medication. Antipsychotics for bipolar disorder. If you're currently experiencing a manic or hypomanic episode , your doctor is likely to prescribe you an antipsychotic. Your doctor is also likely to prescribe antipsychotics if you experience psychotic symptoms in an episode of mania or severe depression. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare – recommends the following antipsychotics: haloperidol – also known as Dozic, Haldol, Haldol Decanoate, Serenace. olanzapine – also known as Zalasta, Zyprexa, ZypAdhera. quetiapine – also known as Atrolak, Biquelle, Ebesque, Seroquel, Tenprolide, Zaluron. risperidone – also known as Risperdal, Risperdal Consta. If your first antipsychotic doesn't work, your doctor might offer another from the list above. If the second doesn't work, your doctor might offer lithium to take together with an antipsychotic. If you take an antipsychotic, you'll need to have regular health checks with your doctor. For more information, see our pages on antipsychotics . Lithium for bipolar disorder. Your doctor might prescribe lithium as a long-term treatment for bipolar disorder. It can help to: Prevent mood episodes. Reduce the risk of experiencing severe mania or recurring depression. Reduce the risk of experiencing suicidal feelings or self-harm. It’s typically a long-term treatment, usually prescribed for at least six months. For lithium to be effective, the dosage must be correct. You'll need regular blood and health checks while taking lithium, to make sure the levels are right for you. For more information, see our page on lithium . I was really quite unwell. Then my psychiatrist changed my medication. I began taking lithium and it really worked for me. I started feeling better pretty quickly. Anticonvulsants for bipolar disorder. Three anticonvulsant drugs, used as mood stabilisers, are licensed to treat bipolar disorder: carbamazepine – also known as Tegretol. This is sometimes prescribed to treat episodes of mania. It can be prescribed if lithium is ineffective or unsuitable for you. For more information, see our page on carbamazepine. valproate – also known as Depakote, Epilim. This can be used to treat episodes of mania and is typically a long-term treatment. It can be prescribed if lithium is ineffective or unsuitable for you. Your doctor is unlikely to prescribe you valproate if you're able to become pregnant. This is because it can lead to significant risks in pregnancy. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is updating its recommendations on the use of valproate. But if you’re currently taking valproate, it’s important to continue taking it unless your doctor tells you otherwise. For more information, see our page on valproate. lamotrigine – also known as Lamictal. This is licensed to treat severe depression in bipolar disorder, but NICE does not recommend it for treating mania. If you're pregnant and taking lamotrigine, NICE recommends regular check-ups. For more information, see our page on lamotrigine. For more information, see our pages on mood stabilisers . Medication can help keep your moods on an even keel, but it is trial and error. Antidepressants for bipolar disorder. Your doctor might offer you a type of antidepressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . Antidepressants might be offered in combination with one of the medications described above. Remember : always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medications together, or closely following one another. The medications could interact badly with each other. For example, combining lithium with SSRIs can increase the risk of side effects like serotonin syndrome . For more information, see our pages on antidepressants . It took me almost 11 years of living with the disorder before I found the right medication to keep my episodes at bay, and my moods properly stabilised."

"Supporting someone with bipolar disorder. This page is for friends, partners and family who want to support someone with bipolar disorder. Seeing someone you care about going through the symptoms of bipolar disorder can feel distressing. But you can offer support in lots of ways, while also looking after your own wellbeing. This page covers how you can : Be open about bipolar disorder. Learn their warning signs and triggers. Make a plan for difficult times. Discuss behaviour you find challenging. Avoid making assumptions. Look after yourself. Be open about bipolar disorder. Being open to talking and listening to someone’s experiences can help them feel supported and accepted. You could try to: Let them know you want to understand what they’re going through, rather than trying to fix things for them. Ask open questions to learn more about how they’re feeling. For example, 'what's it like having bipolar?' Or 'what do you need me to understand about it?'. Avoid minimising their experiences. For example, saying things like ‘everyone goes through tough times’ could make someone feel that you haven’t understood how hard things are for them. Listen rather than give advice. You can learn more about these experiences by reading blogs by family and friends on the Bipolar UK website. Learn their warning signs and triggers. Most people have some warning signs that they're about to experience a mood episode . Many people will also have triggers, such as stress , which can bring on an episode. Try to: Talk to them about their warning signs, exploring what they may be. Let them know if you've noticed behaviours that often happen before an episode. For example, you could say ‘I’ve noticed that you’ve been sleeping less, and I’m worried you might be becoming unwell’. Understand what their triggers are and how you can help avoid or manage them. Looking out for patterns, talking, remaining calm and supportive is essential. Make a plan for difficult times. When they are feeling well, try talking to them about the support you can offer during a mood episode . This can help you both feel more stable and in control of what's happening. You could discuss ideas such as: Noting things down that have or haven’t worked in the past. This could be by writing notes in a diary or on your phone, or by recording voice notes. Agreeing code words or signs that they are struggling. For example, you could plan words or symbols between you to mean different feelings. They could use these as a quick way to ask for help if they’re struggling to describe how they’re feeling. Offering a second opinion about projects or commitments, to help them consider whether they’re taking too much on. Helping them manage money while they’re unwell, if they’d like you to. Helping them keep a routine, including regular meals and sleeping patterns. Developing a crisis plan. For ideas on what to include see our information on planning for a possible crisis. It can also help to discuss how someone wants you to treat them when they are coming out of a period of ill health. Try to follow their lead about how much they want to talk about what happened while they were unwell. Discuss behaviour you find challenging. Supporting someone with their mental health can at times be very difficult, frustrating or frightening. If someone is hearing or seeing things that you don't, they might feel angry, annoyed or confused if you don't share their beliefs. What feels real for them is real in those moments. If this happens: Stay calm if you can. Help with breathing exercises or relaxation if they feel able to try these. Focus on supporting them with how they’re feeling, rather than confirming or challenging their reality. Let them know that, although you don't share the belief, you understand that it feels real for them. During a manic episode , they may do things that feel embarrassing, strange or upsetting to you. You could try to: Calmly discuss your feelings with them when they’re feeling able to. Explain how specific things they've done make you feel, rather than making general statements about their actions. Avoid being judgemental or critical. And don't hold onto things that were said when they were unwell. Especially if they’ve apologised or told you they didn’t mean it.  We also have a page on supporting someone who is experiencing psychosis . During a depressive episode , they may avoid contacting or responding to people. This can be difficult to cope with. You may feel worried about them, or rejected. You could try to: Avoid taking things personally if you can. Keep checking in, even though they might not respond. Send short messages that don’t require a lengthy response. When they feel well again, you could discuss what might help you both cope with similar difficult times in future. For example, you could agree a code word, emoji or picture that they could send you to let you know they’re safe but can’t talk right now. What feels real is real for him in that moment. It helps when I respect that and comfort him rather than trying to explain it's not 'real' for everyone else. Avoid making assumptions. You might find yourself always looking out for signs that they are starting a bipolar episode. This is completely understandable. But this might not be the most helpful way to support them. You can: Remember everyone is different. It's possible to display a range of emotions and behaviour, while still feeling well overall. Try not to assume that any change in mood is a sign that they're unwell. Each person’s experience is unique. If you're not sure, talk to them to check. Remind yourself that setbacks are normal. They may be managing their symptoms well for some time and then have a more difficult period. Avoid assuming what someone can and can’t do. If you think they need help, offer your support, but try not to start handling things for them without checking that this is what they want or need. If those around me are concerned about whether changes are symptomatic of relapse, I encourage them to ask, not assume. Look after yourself. It's important to spend time and energy looking after yourself. You may feel very worried about the person you're supporting, but looking after your own wellbeing means you can keep supporting them. For example, you could try to: Talk to someone you trust. This could be a friend, family member, your GP, or a helpline. Bipolar UK also has support groups for family, friends, and carers. Involve trusted family and friends in supporting them, with their consent. Sharing out different responsibilities may make things feel more manageable. If you’re part of a group supporting someone, such as a family or group of friends, try to make sure the support is consistent. Find ways to relax. For example, spend time on a hobby you enjoy or try relaxation exercises. Pace yourself. Take things one step at a time and remember that you’re doing something really valuable in trying to support someone. So be proud of any small wins and try to celebrate these. Be kind to yourself when you’re struggling. It’s okay not to handle everything as well as you’d like or to make mistakes. For more information on looking after yourself, see our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else and improving your wellbeing . You can also visit the Carers UK website. My husband and I both have bipolar so it was inevitable that we'd have to rely on each other at times."

"What is body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)? Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an anxiety disorder related to body image. It's closely related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) . You might be given a diagnosis of BDD if you: Experience obsessive worries about one or more perceived flaws in your physical appearance, and the flaw can't be seen by others or appears very slight. Develop compulsive and repetitive behaviours and routines, such as excessive use of mirrors or picking your skin, to deal with the worries you have about the way you look. Experience significant disruption to your daily life as a result of these worries and behaviours, such as avoiding social situations. BDD can vary in severity from person to person and from day to day. Worries about your appearance may make it difficult to go out in public or see other people. It can have an impact on your work life and relationships with other people. For more detailed information on symptoms see our page on the symptoms of BDD . I became increasingly insular and erratic, making decisions that affected my health and damaged my relationships. I'd skip school, cancel plans with friends and call in sick at work. BDD may also cause other problems, such as: Feelings of shame, guilt or loneliness. Depression or anxiety. Isolating yourself to avoid situations that cause you anxiety or discomfort. Misuse of alcohol or other drugs. Feeling you need unnecessary medical procedures, such as cosmetic surgery. Eating disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Self-harm. Suicidal thoughts. Many people with BDD don't seek help because they're worried that people will judge them or think they're ‘vain’. This means that many people with BDD are likely to experience it for a long time before seeking support. My friends and family would often remind me of how beautiful I was but that never mattered. I wasn't good enough. I was trapped inside my own head, with no escape."
"What are the symptoms of BDD? People with BDD see themselves differently to how others see them. Although everyone's experience of BDD is unique, there are some common signs. This page covers: Obsessive worries about your body. Compulsive and repetitive behaviours. I'm constantly worrying about my appearance to the extent that I rarely feel present in any social situation. Obsessive worries about your body. If you have BDD, you may experience intrusive, negative thoughts about one specific area of your body, or several areas of your body, which you think are: Out of proportion, such as being too big or too small. Disfigured or the wrong shape. Lacking symmetry. The wrong colour or texture. These thoughts cause you significant anxiety, and you'll often spend several hours a day thinking about the area or areas of concern. BDD can affect any area of the body, but common areas of anxiety include your skin, hair, nose, chin, teeth, lips or genitals. Some people with BDD are preoccupied with negative thoughts about their general appearance rather than a specific feature, and may feel that they’re ‘generally ugly’ or out of proportion. I've struggled with BDD for 13 years. It changes. Sometimes it's something little, like my nose, that is really bothering me. Sometimes every centimetre of my body just feels wrong. BDD and eating disorders. BDD and eating disorders share similar symptoms, such as: Having poor body image. Worrying excessively about your physical appearance. Developing compulsive behaviours to try to deal with these worries. But BDD and eating disorders aren't the same. When a person is experiencing an eating disorder, they're mainly concerned about their weight and shape, and develop eating problems to control this. Someone experiencing BDD may also experience concerns about weight and shape, but is likely to experience other concerns around body image – for example, they may also have concerns about a particular facial feature. You don't need to have an eating disorder to be diagnosed with BDD. Some people with BDD experience an eating disorder but not all people with eating disorders have BDD. A mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, can assess your symptoms to help you find out whether you're experiencing BDD, an eating disorder or both. For more information see our page on eating disorders and our pages on eating problems more broadly. Compulsive and repetitive behaviours. If you have BDD, you develop compulsive and repetitive behaviours and routines to deal with the anxiety you feel about your appearance. You may spend hours each day carrying out these behaviours to try to reduce your anxiety. The behaviours may briefly lessen your worries, or they may make you feel worse. Common compulsive behaviours include repetitively or obsessively: Checking your appearance in mirrors, or avoiding mirrors completely. Using heavy make-up to try to hide the area you're concerned about. Changing your posture or wearing heavy clothes to disguise your shape. Seeking reassurance about your appearance. Overexercising, often in a way that targets the area you're worried about. Body checking with your fingers. Picking your skin to make it smooth. Using tanning products or skin-lighteners. Weighing yourself. Brushing or styling your hair. Comparing yourself with other people. Changing your clothes. Shopping for beauty products or over-the-counter treatments. Taking selfies. Using social media image filters or photo editing apps. Seeking cosmetic surgery or having other types of medical treatment to change the part of you that causes you distress. Some of these behaviours, such as picking your skin and overexercising , are considered self-harm behaviours. For more information, see our pages on self-harm . I'm performing exhausting, compulsive rituals that simply perpetuate this cycle of anxiety. It’s like being stuck in a noisy hamster wheel spinning endlessly inside a hall of mirrors. What is muscle dysmorphia? Muscle dysmorphia (or muscle dysmorphic disorder) is a type of BDD where you experience obsessive worries about your body being too small, skinny or not muscular enough. Despite these worries, you're of average build. Or in some cases exceptionally muscular. This often leads to compulsive behaviours that focus on building muscle that can sometimes be damaging, such as: Overexercising, particularly lifting weights. Dieting. Taking nutritional supplements. Abusing steroids and other substances. You can find out more about muscle dysmorphia on the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation website."
"What causes BDD? No one knows exactly what causes BDD. It can affect people of all genders, and commonly begins in adolescence. But research suggests that there are a number of different factors that could mean you’re more likely to experience BDD. For example: ​Abuse or bullying. Low self-esteem. Fear of being rejected. Perfectionism or comparing yourself with others. Genetics. Depression, anxiety or OCD. Abuse or bullying. Going through traumatic experiences such as abuse or bullying can cause you to develop a negative self-image, which can lead you to have obsessions about your appearance. This is particularly true if you experienced abuse, bullying or other forms of trauma when you were a teenager, as it’s a time when you may have felt sensitive about the way you looked or how your body was changing. LGBTQIA+ and BDD Some research also suggests that people who identify as LGBTQIA+ may be more likely to have BDD. The possible reasons for this are complex. But part of the explanation could be that experiences of homophobia, biphobia or transphobia may contribute to feelings of low self-esteem, which include difficult feelings about our physical appearance. Find out more about LGBTQIA+ and mental health . Low self-esteem. If you have low self-esteem , you may become fixated on aspects of your appearance that you want to improve. This is more likely if you attach a lot of importance to how you look, or if you feel your appearance is the most valuable thing about you. Racism and BDD. If you’ve experienced racism you may hold negative views about yourself because of how you’ve been treated. This can lead to low self-esteem . You may also have experienced colourism , which is when someone treats you differently based on how light or dark your skin shade is. Subtle messages in society and the media about lighter skin being preferable can make some of us feel like our skin shade is too dark, or like our hair or features don’t meet society’s ‘ideal’. This can contribute to the pressure we feel to change parts of ourselves. Some people who have BDD may change parts of their identity, such as their skin colour, to deal with this. See our racism and mental health page for more information. Fear of being rejected. If you worry about not fitting in, or being rejected or lonely , you may develop thought patterns that can lead to BDD. For example, if you believe that you need to look a certain way to maintain friends or find a partner, you may develop obsessive worries about your appearance. If a relationship then breaks down or a friendship group changes, this could make your worries worse. There have been so many times where I've looked in the mirror and just cried. Or I've thought I looked ok but 2 seconds later I'll feel that it's all still wrong. Perfectionism or comparing yourself with others. Messages about body image that we get from films, magazines, social media and adverts can have a negative impact on our body image and self-esteem. They can give us unachievable ideas about how we should look and make us feel we're not good enough. Apps and filters that improve the way we look online can also contribute to this. If you try to appear physically 'perfect' or you regularly compare your appearance to other people, you may be more likely to develop BDD. Or if you do activities that are very focused on your body – for example, modelling, bodybuilding or fitness – you may also be at greater risk. My hardest trait was comparing myself to others, especially girls who I thought were flawless. Genetics. Some evidence suggests that BDD is more common in people whose family members also have BDD. But it's difficult to know whether symptoms – such as believing that you're disfigured or frequent mirror checking – are inherited from your parents' genes or picked up from their behaviour. Depression, anxiety or OCD. People with other mental health problems, specifically depression , anxiety and OCD , are also more likely to have BDD. But it's unclear whether depression, anxiety or OCD are a cause of BDD, or if BDD is a cause of these mental health problems."
"What treatments are there for BDD? If you think you may have BDD, speak to your GP . They can refer you for an assessment and help you access treatment. If you're diagnosed with BDD, your GP should offer you treatment options recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) . This page covers the main treatments that NICE recommends: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Medication. Specialist services for BDD. What other treatments are there? I started to believe in myself and ‘live in the moment’. I finally started to feel good about how I looked. As it's common for a lot of people to worry about their appearance, the signs of BDD can be missed by professionals. If you feel your GP doesn't recognise your symptoms and you're not getting the treatment you need, you may find it useful to get an advocate to support you. Cosmetic surgery and BDD. If you've seen a healthcare professional about having cosmetic surgery or medical treatment for skin conditions and they think you may have BDD, you might be referred to a mental health professional who specialises in BDD. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a form of talking therapy that aims to show connections between your thoughts, feelings and behaviours. It can also help you develop practical skills to manage them. Sometimes this involves using self-help materials such as books or computer programs. The treatment you're offered may depend on the severity of your symptoms, but ideally you should be given CBT before you're prescribed any medication. It can be delivered via telephone, video, or face to face with a therapist. Either one-to-one or in a group. The aim of CBT for BDD is to help you feel less anxious about your body by: Helping you change your attitude to body image and physical appearance. Exploring your worries about your perceived physical flaw(s). Reducing your need to carry out compulsive behaviours. For more detailed information on CBT and how to access it see our dedicated page on CBT. Exposure and response prevention in CBT. A type of CBT – known as exposure and response prevention (ERP) – is recommended for BDD. This technique helps you confront your obsessions so that you become used to dealing with them. This involves: Facing situations where you'd normally think obsessively about the part of your appearance that worries you, to help you cope better with these situations over time. Developing techniques to help you avoid carrying out compulsive behaviours (such as mirror checking) when you'd normally want to. This technique needs to be carefully managed to avoid causing more anxiety and distress, so it's important that you understand the treatment fully and feel comfortable with your therapist. Living with body dysmorphia. Having CBT was the best decision I ever made. I was able to completely transform the way I thought. Read Carly's story Medication. You may be prescribed antidepressants , either on their own or in combination with CBT, if: CBT isn't successful in treating your BDD. Your BDD is moderately to severely affecting how you live your day-to-day life. The type of antidepressant your GP provides will usually be a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . These can help reduce obsessive thoughts and behaviours. SSRIs can cause unpleasant side effects for some people, so it's a good idea to discuss this with your GP before starting. You can also take a look at our information on what you should do before starting medication . If a first course of SSRIs and more intensive CBT isn't effective, the next step is usually to try a different SSRI or another antidepressant called clomipramine . Specialist services for BDD. If other treatments aren't helpful, your GP may refer you for specialist help . This could be through community-based mental health and social care , where you'll be given a more thorough assessment by the community mental health team (CMHT) . Your CMHT will develop a potential care plan with you, which may include support from a service that specialises in BDD. Access to specialist services is limited across the country and you may need to travel outside your local area. Waiting times for specialist services can also be very long. What other treatments are there? Everyone is different and the treatments recommended by the NICE guidelines don't always work for everyone. You may find different treatments or self-care techniques for BDD helpful, either on their own or alongside other treatments. The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation also provides further information about treatments for BDD on its website."
"What can I do to help myself? Treatment of BDD often includes a combination of strategies, including self-help. Below are some ideas you could try to help you manage your BDD: Use self-help materials. Do things to improve your self-esteem. Try support groups. Look after yourself. Use self-help materials. Many people find self-help materials, such as books or computer programs, useful in managing their BDD. Self-help materials are often based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which have been shown to be particularly effective in treating BDD. Making small steps to accept but challenge your worries can reduce your compulsive behaviours. You may decide to use self-help materials alongside professional help, or you may use them to develop your own coping strategies. You can find self-help resources for BDD on the following websites: Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation. OCD Action. OCD-UK. Several self-help programmes are available for free via computer or via prescription from your GP. See the NHS self-help therapies page for more information on these. Do things to improve your self-esteem. Celebrate your successes. No matter how small they may seem, take time to praise yourself and notice what you did well. It could also help to remember past successes. Accept compliments. You could make a note of them to look over when you're feeling low or doubting yourself. Ask people what they like about you. It's likely that they see you differently to how you see yourself. Write a list of things you like about yourself. For example, you could include character traits, skills or experience, beliefs or causes that matter to you, or things you enjoy doing. You could ask other people for suggestions too. Try support groups. Support groups and peer support offer an opportunity to meet other people who also have BDD and to be part of a support network that understands what you're going through. Hearing about how other people have coped with similar feelings and experiences can make you feel less isolated. You can find details of support groups for BDD on the following websites: Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation. OCD Action. OCD-UK. Or contact Mind's Infoline or a local Mind to see what support there is in your area. You can also access peer support online. Communities like Mind's Side by Side can be a good way of getting support at times when you don't feel like seeing people face-to-face or if there aren't any groups nearby. Look after yourself. Taking time to look after yourself physically and emotionally can help support your recovery and improve your quality of life. Try to get enough sleep. Getting too little or too much sleep can have a big impact on how you feel.  Think about your diet. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels.  Try to do some physical activity. Exercise can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing and some people find it helps improve their self-esteem.  Spend time outside. Spending time in green space can help your wellbeing.  Try to avoid recreational drugs and alcohol. While you might want to use recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings about yourself, in the long run they can make you feel worse and can prevent you from dealing with underlying problems.  For more information about looking after yourself see our pages on improving your wellbeing, self-care for anxiety and tips for improving your self-esteem ."
"How can friends and family help? This page is for friends and family members who want to support someone with BDD. It can be upsetting and frustrating to see a loved one's obsessive worries and compulsive behaviours affect their day-to-day life. But there are a number of things you can do to support them: Accept their feelings. Friends and family can help a lot by accepting the feelings of the person with BDD and recognising that they find it difficult to cope with them. While you may not understand their concerns about their appearance, it's important to recognise that these feelings are very real to them. Try to avoid judging them as 'vain' or 'self-obsessed'. Offer space to talk. It can be particularly difficult for someone experiencing BDD to acknowledge and speak about their thoughts, especially if they find them embarrassing. But speaking can be a first step in seeking help. Help them seek treatment and support. Our page on how to support someone to seek help has lots of suggestions and tips you can try. These include emotional and practical support, what to do if someone doesn't want help, where to go in an emergency, and how to look after yourself. Offer support with self-help. If the person with BDD is working to a self-help programme , either on their own or with a therapist, you might be able to support them with this. Give practical support. Offering practical support can give them time to attend appointments or use self-help materials. Or you could help with childcare or household chores. Everyone's situation is different so ask them what they would find helpful. Celebrate their successes. Stopping compulsive behaviours can be very difficult and it'll take time. Celebrating the small steps, such as spending less time grooming or carrying out fewer repetitions, can help keep your loved one motivated. My friends and family are absolutely wonderful. Those closest have taken the time to understand the disorder and as a result they're incredibly mindful of the irrationality it can cause. They support me in every way. Don't take it personally. It can be particularly difficult if your friend or family member's BDD means that at times they don't want to see you or they withdraw from social contact. Try to be aware that this is due to their negative feelings about their appearance rather than anything you're likely to have done. Learn their triggers. Some people with BDD find certain situations difficult and find they can provoke more repetitive behaviour. Sometimes these situations can't be avoided. For example, seeing mirrors in shops or public toilets. But taking steps to gradually build up to the situations with them may help. Be consistent. People with BDD may seek reassurance about the way they look. Try not to get drawn into debates about their appearance and encourage others not to do the same. Boost their confidence. Encourage them to do the things they enjoy. Offering praise that doesn't focus on the way they look can also help to raise their self-esteem. Get support for yourself. It can be distressing to be close to someone experiencing BDD, particularly if you're caring for them . You might find it useful to talk to other people who are in the same situation as you and to find out more about these complex problems. The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation provides information on BDD for friends and family, as well as support groups for carers. Friendship and body dysmorphic disorder. Each tiny gesture helps keep the malevolent voice in my mind at bay. Read Catherine's story If you're the parent of a child with BDD, the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation has some useful tips on how to support them."

"This page covers: What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)? When is BPD diagnosed? Different views on diagnosis. What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)? Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a type of personality disorder . You might be diagnosed with a personality disorder if you have difficulties with how you think and feel about yourself and other people. And if these difficulties make it hard to cope day to day. Experiences of BPD are different for different people. You may experience emotions that are very intense, overwhelming or changeable. You may also experience difficulties with relationships or your sense of identity. Our page on experiences of BPD has more information on what it's like living with BPD. Everything hurts more than it seems to for everyone else, and any 'thick skin' you're supposed to have just isn't there. You may hear other names for BPD, such as: Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD). Emotional intensity disorder (EID). Borderline pattern personality disorder (borderline pattern PD). It's your choice which term, if any, you use. People have very different views on BPD and there are ongoing debates about the diagnosis of personality disorders . Some people find a BPD diagnosis helpful or validating. Some find it unhelpful or stigmatising. There's no right or wrong way to understand or describe your experiences. The important thing to remember is that you deserve support and understanding. When is BPD diagnosed? You might be given a diagnosis of BPD if you experience at least five of the following things. And if they’ve lasted for a long time and have a big impact on different parts of your daily life: Feeling very worried about people abandoning you, and like you'd try very hard to stop that happening. Having intense emotions that last from a few hours to a few days and can change quickly (such as feeling very happy and confident to suddenly feeling low and sad). Feeling insecure about who you are, with your sense of self changing significantly depending on who you're with. Finding it really hard to make and keep stable relationships, and often viewing relationships as completely perfect or completely bad. Feeling empty a lot of the time. Acting impulsively and doing things that could harm you, such as binge eating, using drugs and alcohol, or driving dangerously. Using self-harm to manage your feelings or feeling suicidal. Feeling intense anger, which can be difficult to control. Experiencing paranoia or dissociation in moments of extreme stress. The worst part is the insecure relationships. When I'm attached, they're my whole world – it's crippling. I care so deeply about how long they take to reply or their tone, because I'm so afraid of losing them. Different views on diagnosis. Because you only need to experience five of these difficulties to be given a diagnosis of BPD, it can be a very broad diagnosis which includes lots of different people with very different experiences. Those of us who've been diagnosed with BPD have different views on whether the label is helpful. Some of us find it useful to have a diagnosis because we feel it explains and helps us to understand our difficulties, or gives us a sense of relief and validation. It may also be helpful for accessing treatment or support. Or to put a name to our experiences and connect with others. Even though I haven't been offered much support, just having a diagnosis helps me feel my suffering is validated. On the other hand, some of us don’t find our diagnosis helpful. We may find it stigmatising and feel it suggests that there’s something wrong with who we are. It can also sometimes be a barrier to getting the support we need. Then there are also some of us who disagree entirely with the current system of diagnosing personality disorders and prefer not to describe our experiences as medical problems. We may see them more as a response to trauma , difficult life events or problems in our society. Our page on why personality disorder is a controversial diagnosis has more information. I don't tell people I have BPD because I don't like labelling myself. I just say I have depression / anxiety. But I know I have BPD. I feel things so intensely sometimes that I lose control of my senses. It's one of the worst feelings, but I've learnt to cope."
"What's it like to live with BPD? Your experience of living with BPD is unique to you, but this page describes some common experiences that you might recognise: Difficult feelings and behaviour towards yourself. Difficult feelings and behaviour towards others. Problems with drugs or alcohol. BPD and other mental health problems. Facing stigma about BPD. My experience is that I have to keep my emotions inside, because I get told I'm overreacting. So I end up feeling like I'm trapped inside my body screaming while no one can hear me. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. Difficult feelings and behaviour towards yourself. How you might think or feel Lonely. Overwhelmed by the strength of your emotions and how quickly they change. Like there's something inherently wrong with you, and that it's your fault if bad things happen to you because you deserve them. Like you're a bad person, or not a real person at all. That you don't know what you want from life, or what you like or dislike. Empty, numb or like you have no purpose. Like your feelings are impossible to understand or describe. Like you're a child in an adult world. How you might behave as a result Self-harming or attempting suicide. Overspending or binge eating. Using recreational drugs, alcohol or smoking to try to cope with your emotions. Quitting just before achieving something, or avoiding activities where you think you might fail or be disappointed. Often changing jobs, hobbies, goals or plans. Keeping very busy so you're never alone. My BPD affects every part of my life – relationships, identity, career choices, moods. I changed my name twice by deed poll. It's a terrible, painful feeling not knowing who you are. A real struggle some days to battle everything. Difficult feelings and behaviour towards others. How you might think or feel That friends or partners will leave you forever if they're angry or upset with you. That people are judging or thinking badly about you. Like no one understands you, or you’re not like other people and will never be able to understand them. That people are either completely perfect and kind, or bad and hurtful, and there's no middle ground (this is sometimes called 'splitting', or black-and-white thinking). Wanting to be close to others but also feeling scared of close relationships. Like the world is a scary and dangerous place, and you want to run away and hide. How you might behave as a result Getting very angry or frustrated with people. Struggling to trust people. Having unrealistic expectations of people or contacting them very frequently. Wanting to be close to people but worrying they'll leave or reject you, and so avoiding or pushing them away. Spending a lot of time thinking and worrying about things that other people say or do. Asking for lots of reassurance or testing people’s commitment or opinion of you. Distancing yourself from people or ending relationships with friends or partners because you think they might leave you. Anxiously looking out for signs that people might reject you.  It's like there's something missing inside me. And no one understands when I try to explain how I feel. Problems with drugs or alcohol. Some people with BPD might be more likely to misuse drugs and alcohol as a way of trying to cope with the difficult emotions they experience. You can find more information, including where to get support, on our pages on recreational drugs and alcohol . You can also find confidential advice about drugs and alcohol on the FRANK website. BPD can be exhausting. My mind is a constant rollercoaster of emotions. When the emotions are happy and exhilarating it's the best feeling in the world. BPD and other mental health problems. It's common to experience other mental health problems and experiences alongside BPD, which could include: Anxiety and panic attacks. Depression. Eating problems. Dissociative disorders. Psychosis or hearing voices. Bipolar disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex PTSD. Sleep problems. It took a long time to get my BPD/EUPD diagnosis, because of also having other disorders. But I'm at a happy place in life now thanks to a variety of factors. Facing stigma about BPD. Because BPD is a complex diagnosis that not everyone understands well, you might find some people have a negative image of it, or have misconceptions about you. This can be very upsetting and frustrating, especially if someone who feels this way is a friend, colleague, family member or a health care professional. Some people, even health professionals, can view BPD as something which is untreatable or makes people ‘difficult’ to help. This is unfair and untrue. You may have experienced mistrust, judgement, or a lack of empathy from people in the past. If you’ve been treated in this way, it’s understandable you may be worried about seeking help or telling people about your diagnosis. For me, BPD is a label which acts as a disadvantage in life. It knocks my confidence. It's important to remember that you aren't alone, and you don't have to put up with misconceptions. Here are some options for you to think about: Show people this information. This could help them better understand what your diagnosis means. Get more involved in your treatment. Our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem provide guidance on having your say in your treatment, making your voice heard, and overcoming barriers. Know your rights. Our pages on legal rights have more information, including how you can complain about your care. Take action with Mind. See our campaigning page for details of the different ways you can get involved with helping us challenge stigma. The stigma is the worst part for me. I'm a caring and empathic soul who'd do anything for the people I love."
"What causes BPD? There's no clear reason why some people experience difficulties associated with BPD. Women are given this diagnosis more often than men – more research needs to be done to understand why this is. But it can affect people of all genders and backgrounds. Researchers think that BPD is caused by a combination of factors, including: Stressful or traumatic life events. Genetic factors. One of the things I struggled with was a feeling of 'why me' – I felt others had experienced far worse and could deal with it so why couldn't I. Over time I've realised that lots of low level issues are as valid a reason for struggling as a few bigger traumas. Stressful or traumatic life events. If you get a BPD diagnosis you're more likely than most people to have had difficult or traumatic experiences growing up, such as: Often having felt afraid, upset, unsupported or invalidated. Family difficulties or instability, such as living with a parent or carer who experienced an addiction. Sexual, physical or emotional abuse or neglect. Losing a parent. Difficult childhood experiences may cause you to develop particular coping strategies, or beliefs about yourself and other people. These can become less helpful in time and cause you distress. You might also be struggling with feelings of anger , anxiety and depression . You might also experience BPD without having any history of traumatic or stressful life events. Or you might have had other types of difficult experiences. If you already experience some of these difficulties, then experiencing stress or trauma as an adult could make things worse. Our pages on how to manage stress and post-traumatic stress disorder have some tips on how to cope. Because I don't have many memories of healthy emotional behaviour or relationships I feel totally at sea dealing with these things. When I get let down, it just reinforces my belief that the world is full of bad people who won't be kind – like my parents. Genetic factors. You're more likely to get a diagnosis of BPD if someone in your close family also has one. This suggests that genetic factors could contribute to BPD. But we also know that the environment we grow up in and our early relationships can impact the way we think, feel and behave as adults. So it's difficult for researchers to know exactly how much of a role genes play. It's possible that a combination of factors could be involved. Genetics might make you more vulnerable to developing BPD. Whereas stressful, difficult or traumatic life experiences could then trigger these vulnerabilities. More research is needed to understand this area. I saw my parents and family members regularly behave in out-of-control ways and I thought that was normal. Can children and young people be diagnosed with BPD? It's very hard to diagnose BPD in children and young people because you go through so many changes as you grow up. But you might be given the diagnosis as a teenager if your difficulties have lasted for long enough and BPD is the diagnosis that best matches what you're experiencing. You may also hear the term ‘emerging borderline personality disorder’. YoungMinds has more information about BPD and emerging BPD for young people."
"This page covers: Challenges with getting a BPD diagnosis. What can I do if I disagree with my diagnosis. Challenges with getting a BPD diagnosis. There are many reasons why you may experience challenges with getting a BPD diagnosis, including get the wrong diagnosis. The symptoms of BPD are very broad, and some can be similar to or overlap with other mental health problems, such as: Bipolar disorder. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD). Depression. Anxiety. Psychosis. Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Unfortunately, there are lots of assumptions and misunderstandings around BPD. Not every doctor or health professional understands it. And there are lots of disagreements about how BPD should be described, diagnosed or treated. You may experience BPD and other mental health problems at the same time. We also don't all experience or express our pain in the same ways. So this can make it harder for someone to understand what’s going on for us, and which diagnosis or support best fit what we need. Because of this, you might: Not get a diagnosis of BPD when you feel you should have one. Get a diagnosis of a different mental health problem which you don't agree with. Get a BPD diagnosis when you feel you should have a different diagnosis. Get a BPD diagnosis when you feel you shouldn’t have a diagnosis at all. I had the wrong diagnosis for nearly 30 years. I felt like a freak because, when reading up about the diagnosis I was given, there was no mention of my other symptoms. What can I do if I disagree with my diagnosis? If you're worried that your diagnosis doesn't fit the way you feel, it's important to discuss it with a mental health professional so you can make sure you're getting the right support to help you.

"What treatments can help? This page covers: Talking therapies. Therapeutic communities. Medication. How can I get treatment? Talking therapies. Talking therapies are thought to be the most helpful treatment for BPD, although more research is needed into the types of treatments that are most effective. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in health care – suggests that the following kinds of talking treatments may be helpful: Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) – uses individual and group therapy to help you learn skills to cope with difficult emotions. So far, NICE has recommended this treatment for women with BPD who often self-harm, and it's also thought to be helpful for other groups.  Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) – aims to help you recognise and understand your and other people's mental states, and to examine your thoughts about yourself and others. You can read more about MBT for DBT on the NHS website. My DBT journey. I see a future for myself now that I didn't see before the therapy. Read this blogger's story NICE says that other types of talking therapy could potentially be helpful too, including: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – aims to help you understand how your thoughts and beliefs might affect your feelings and behaviour.  Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) – combines CBT's practical methods with a focus on the relationship between you and your therapist. This can help you look at how you relate to people, including yourself, and what patterns have developed for you. Other talking therapies – such as schema-focused cognitive therapy, psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy or arts therapies.  Mentalisation-based therapy. I identified with 3 strangers in a way that I had never been able to with anyone else. Ever. Read Jessica's story Therapeutic communities. Therapeutic communities are specially designed programmes where you work with a group of other people experiencing mental health problems to support each other to recover. You might live together some or all of the time, or meet up regularly. Activities can include different types of individual or group therapy, as well as household chores and social activities. The Consortium for Therapeutic Communities provides a directory of therapeutic communities in the UK. I've educated myself about emotions. I've learned from books, therapy, psychologists, friends. The most important thing is that it's never too late to learn. Medication. NICE doesn’t recommend using medication to treat the ongoing symptoms of BPD. This is because there aren't any drugs that are known to be effective. But we know that in practice doctors often do prescribe medication for people diagnosed with BPD. This could include antidepressants , antipsychotics or mood stabilisers . You might also take this medication for other mental health problems you’re experiencing. Or you may be given medication to help you manage specific symptoms. In a crisis situation, your doctor might prescribe you a sleeping pill or minor tranquilliser to help you feel calmer. But they shouldn’t prescribe these for longer than a week. Your doctor should give you information about any drug you take. This information should be in a format that you can access and understand. They should also give you regular check-ups to review your medication. So if this isn’t happening and you'd like to talk about your medication, make an appointment to discuss it with your doctor. I've found the right medication regime for me and try to keep my life structured. It's not easy, but recovery is possible. Medication really helps some people but isn't right for others. Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.  Our pages on coming off medication give guidance on how to come off medication safely. How can I get treatment? To get treatment on the NHS you should visit your GP, who can refer you to your local community mental health team (CMHT) for an assessment. If you receive NHS treatment, it should be in line with NICE guidelines . These say that: Anyone with possible BPD should have a structured assessment with a specialist in mental health before being given a diagnosis. You should have a say in the type of treatment you're offered. If you're not getting the type of treatment you think would most help you, it could help to talk to an advocate. You can read the full guidelines and additional recommendations for BPD in English or Welsh on the NICE website . Will I get the help I need in a crisis? Unfortunately, you might find that services in your area aren't always able to provide the best possible care to support you. We know how frustrating and difficult it can be to cope with services that don't provide the exact help you need, exactly when you need it. That's why we're campaigning to improve crisis care across the country. Learn more about our crisis care campaign , and about the different ways you can take action with Mind . Can I go private? Waiting times for talking treatments on the NHS can be long. And specialist services aren't always available on the NHS. Because of this, you may consider going private. Unfortunately, this can be expensive so may not be possible. Some private therapists offer a sliding scale of payment though, depending on your circumstances. So it may be worth checking their website or contacting them to see if this is something they can do.  I was helpless and hopeless for a long time. But when I finally got my head around the fact that only I could make a difference and that there was no magic wand, something clicked. Where else can I get support? Treatment for BPD can be very limited and may vary depending on your circumstances. If you're struggling to access the support you need through the NHS, it might be worth looking into charities or other third sector organisations. For example: Your local Mind may be able to help or suggest other local services.  You could consider trying peer support. This could be through an online community, like Mind's Side by Side. Or through a local support group. For advice on what to do when you're struggling to access the support you need, see our page on facing barriers to seeking help . It began changing when one hospital said there was a way forward, that I didn't have to feel so broken forever. It wasn't plain sailing, but realising there was hope and that other people had gone on to achieve amazing things inspired me."
"You might feel like every day is a struggle. But there are lots of things that could help. This page covers: How can I help myself now? How can I help myself in the longer term? If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. How can I help myself now? If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might help to focus on one feeling at a time. Here are some ideas that you could try to see if they work for you. Different things work at different times for different people, so try to be kind to yourself if some things don’t work for you. Over time, you might develop your own tips to add to this list too. Here are some tips on how to help yourself: If I'm feeling angry, frustrated or restless. If I'm feeling depressed, sad or lonely. If I'm feeling anxious, panicky or tense. If I'm feeling dissociative or spaced out. If I want to self-harm. What helps when I’m having a bad time is more 'practical' than emotional. Delaying my emotions a little until I feel more able to cope. If I'm feeling angry, frustrated or restless. You could: Rip up some paper. Hit a pillow. Do some exercise. Listen to loud music. Do a practical activity like gardening or woodwork.  If I'm feeling depressed, sad or lonely. You could: Wrap up in a blanket and watch your favourite TV show. Write all your negative feelings on a piece of paper and tear it up. Listen to music that you find uplifting or soothing. Write a comforting letter to the part of yourself that is feeling sad or alone. Let yourself cry or sleep. Cuddle a pet or a soft toy.  If I'm feeling anxious, panicky or tense. You could: Make yourself a hot drink and drink it slowly, noticing the taste and smell, the shape of the mug and its weight in your hand. Take 10 deep breaths, counting each one out loud. Write down everything you can think of about where you are right now, such as the time, date, colour of the walls and the furniture in the room. Take a warm bath or shower – this can help change your mood by creating a soothing atmosphere and a distracting physical sensation.  If I'm feeling dissociative or spaced out. You could: Chew a piece of ginger or chilli. Clap your hands and notice the stinging sensation. Drink a glass of ice-cold water.  If I want to self-harm. You could: Rub ice over where you want to hurt yourself. Stick sellotape or a plaster on your skin and peel it off. Take a cold bath or shower.  If I'm feeling very bad but can't put into words how I feel or why, I wear a particular bracelet. My closest friends/family know that this means I'm having a rough time and might need some TLC. How can I help myself in the longer term? Talk to someone. Keep a mood diary. Plan for difficult times. Make a self-care box. Try peer support. Focus on what matters to you. Look after your physical health. Find specialist support for contributing factors. Although it can sometimes be triggering, going online and talking to people who also have BPD is useful. It's supportive and reassuring that I'm not really alone. Talk to someone. It can be hard to reach out when you're not feeling well, but it might help to share difficult thoughts. If you don't feel you can talk to the people around you, you could try contacting a helpline. For example, you can talk to Samaritans for free on 116 123 or [email protected] about anything that's upsetting you.  Keep a mood diary. Recording your moods in a diary could help you spot patterns in what triggers difficult experiences for you. Or notice early signs when they're beginning to happen. Try noting down difficult thoughts or feelings. This might help get them out of your head and make them feel less overwhelming. You can then reflect on them when you feel calmer or talk about them with someone you trust. You could also make a note of what's going well. It's really important to be kind to yourself and recognise difficult steps you’ve taken, or new things you’ve tried. These don’t need to be big things. They could be things like having a shower, going for a walk or sending someone a text. Or managing a difficult situation in a slightly different way. Plan for difficult times. If you're feeling less well you might not be able to tell people what help you want, so it could be helpful to plan ahead. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare – recommends that everyone with BPD has a crisis plan. This should include possible triggers, self-help strategies and details for getting support, and should be shared with you and your GP.  With time, you do learn to cope better with BPD. I've struggled for 15 years, but every year I seem to get stronger and better at coping with it. Make a self-care box. You could put together some things that might help you when you’re struggling – a bit like making a first aid kit for your mental health. For example: Favourite books, films or music. A stress ball or fiddle toy. Helpful sayings or notes of encouragement. Pictures or photos you find comforting. A soft or weighted blanket. Cosy slippers. Something comforting to smell or taste, like a lavender bag or mints. Or you could make a digital self-care kit . You could save this on your phone so you can look at it anytime. You could save photos, music, videos, messages or sayings that you find helpful. Or notes to remind yourself how to manage difficult situations. Try peer support. Peer support brings together people who've had similar experiences. Some people find this very helpful. There are lots of ways to find peer support. You could: See our peer support directory. Ask your local Mind about peer support. Try an online peer support community like Mind's Side by Side. Focus on what matters to you. Sometimes when we're given a mental health diagnosis, it can feel like this defines us as a person. But this isn't true. Try to focus on the things that matter to you. Or things you value about your character, or which make you happy. This could be your values, interests, opinions or passions. It might help to write them down or say them out load. Some people find it helpful to express themselves creatively. And if you don’t know yet what matters to you or what you value about yourself that’s ok too – take your time. It can sometimes be difficult to have a sense of what we enjoy and why we matter when we're feeling low or unwell. Especially if we've been treated badly by others.  Look after your physical health. Looking after your physical health can make a difference to how you feel emotionally. For example, it can help to: Try to improve your sleep. Sleep can help give you the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences.  Think about what you eat. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels.  Try to do some physical activity. Exercise can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing.  Spend time outside. Spending time in green space can boost your wellbeing.  Be careful with alcohol or drug use. While you might want to use drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, in the long run they can make you feel a lot worse and may prevent you from getting the support you need for your mental health.  Find specialist support for contributing factors. If you’ve experienced other issues that have contributed to your problems, it could be helpful to explore the help out there for these too. For example: Abuse or bullying. If you've been abused in childhood, the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) is there to support you, and our pages on abuse and useful contacts for PTSD list many more organisations that could help. Racism. Our pages on racism and mental health have information about the impacts of racism, as well as options for support. This also includes information on racism within the mental health system. And advice on overcoming barriers to getting support. Money problems. Our pages on money and mental health have information about the links between money worries and mental health. This includes advice about managing your money when you're unwell. And options for support with debt, benefits or other financial concerns. Sometimes I have good periods where my symptoms don't really trouble me – other times they're overwhelming. It's hard not to beat myself up for the relapses, but that's something I need to keep working on. It's ok to struggle."
"How can other people help? This information is for friends and family who want to support someone with BPD. If someone you care about is diagnosed with BPD you might sometimes find it hard to understand their feelings or behaviour, or to know how to help. But there are lots of positive things you can do to support them: Be patient. Don't judge. Be calm and consistent. Remind them of their positive traits. Set clear boundaries. Plan ahead. Learn their triggers. Provide distractions. Learn more about BPD. Help them seek treatment and support. Take care of yourself. One thing I find helps is when others validate my emotions, as I often feel guilty for having them. Be patient. If your loved one is struggling to deal with their emotions, try not to get involved in an argument in the heat of the moment. It could be better to wait until you both feel calmer to talk things through. Don't judge. It can be difficult if you don't understand why someone is feeling or behaving in a certain way. Especially if their reactions seem upsetting or unreasonable. But try to remember that you're not in their head and there may be things going on for them that you don't understand. Try to listen, and acknowledge their feelings, rather than judging their reactions. Be calm and consistent. If your loved one is experiencing a lot of overwhelming emotions, this could help them feel more secure and supported and will help in moments of conflict. If you feel yourself becoming angry or upset, try taking some time alone or going for a walk if you can. Remind them of their positive traits. When someone you care about is finding it hard to believe anything good about themself, it can be reassuring to hear all the positive things you see in them. Set clear boundaries. Practising good boundaries and expectations can make a big difference. If your loved one is feeling insecure about being rejected or abandoned, or seems worried about being left alone, it can help to clarify what you can expect from each other and to communicate about this calmly and patiently if things become unclear. Plan ahead. When the person you're supporting is feeling well, ask them how you can help them best when things are difficult.  Learn their triggers. Talk to your loved one and try to find out what sort of situations or conversations might trigger negative thoughts and emotions. Understanding their triggers could help you avoid difficult situations, and feel more prepared when they have strong reactions to certain things. Provide distractions. Sometimes helping to distract someone from difficult feelings can be really useful. Try suggesting activities or tasks, such as watching a film or tidying up. Or you could start something and let them know they're welcome to join in when they feel ready. Learn more about BPD. BPD is a complicated diagnosis, and your loved one might sometimes have to deal with other people's misconceptions on top of trying to manage their mental health problem. Educating yourself can also help you to challenge stigma. Our about BPD and experiences of BPD pages contain more information. Help them seek treatment and support.  And see our page on advocacy in mental health for guidance on how to help them find an advocate. Take care of yourself. Looking after someone else can sometimes be difficult and stressful. It's important to remember that your mental health is important too.  I have a friend who goes for hot chocolate with me every week. To know there is somebody who cares and has time for you, even when you're not sure who you are, that means the world."

"What is depression? Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave. The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary. If you experience milder depression, you might have low mood but still be able to carry on with your daily life. But things may feel harder and less worthwhile. If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings . It starts as sadness then I feel myself shutting down, becoming less capable of coping. Eventually, I just feel numb and empty. When does low mood become depression? We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own. But it might be depression if the feelings become so bad that they interfere with our daily life. Or if they last for several weeks or months.  Are there different types of depression? If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for 2 years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that occurs at a particular time of year, or during a particular season.  Antenatal depression. This is depression that occurs while you are pregnant. It is sometimes called prenatal depression. Postnatal depression (PND). This is depression that occurs in the first year after having a baby. This can include affecting dads and partners.  Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This is a hormone-related disorder that affects your body but also how you feel. This can involve experiencing depression. So your doctor may describe this as a mental health problem.  Sometimes it feels like a black hole but sometimes it feels like I need to cry and scream and kick and shout. Sometimes I go quiet and lock myself in my room and sometimes I have to be doing something at all times of the day to distract myself."
"What are the symptoms of depression? There are many signs and symptoms of depression, and everyone's experience will vary. This page covers: Common signs and symptoms of depression. Anxiety. Self-harm and suicidal feelings. Psychotic symptoms. How might depression affect my day-to-day life? Can depression be a symptom of other mental health problems? I had constant low mood, hopelessness, frustration with myself, feeling like I could cry at any moment. Common signs and symptoms of depression. These are some common signs of depression that you may experience: How you might feel Down, upset or tearful. Restless, agitated or irritable. Guilty, worthless and down on yourself. Empty and numb. Isolated and unable to relate to other people. Finding no pleasure in life or things you usually enjoy. Angry or frustrated over minor things. A sense of unreality. No self-confidence or self-esteem. Hopeless and despairing. Feeling tired all the time. How you might act Avoiding social events and activities you usually enjoy. Self-harming or suicidal behaviour. Difficulty speaking, thinking clearly or making decisions. Losing interest in sex. Difficulty remembering or concentrating on things. Using more tobacco, alcohol or other drugs than usual. Difficulty sleeping, or sleeping too much. No appetite and losing weight, or eating more than usual and gaining weight. Physical aches and pains with no obvious physical cause. Moving very slowly, or being restless and agitated. It felt like I was really tired, all the time. I had no energy or emotion about anything. Anxiety. It's very common to experience depression and anxiety together. Some symptoms of depression can also be symptoms of anxiety, for example: Feeling restless. Finding it difficult to concentrate. Struggling to sleep.  I flit between states of anxiety and depression. At times, each seems to fuel the other. Self-harm and suicidal feelings. If you're feeling low, you might self-harm to cope with difficult feelings. Although this might make you feel better in the short term, self-harm can be very dangerous. When you're feeling really low and hopeless, you may also find yourself thinking about suicide. This could be thinking about the idea of suicide, or considering a plan to end your life. These thoughts can feel difficult to control, and can be very frightening. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. Psychotic symptoms. If you experience depression, you might also experience some psychotic symptoms. These may include delusions, such as paranoia . Or they may be hallucinations, such as hearing voices . If you experience psychotic symptoms as part of depression, they're likely to be linked to your depressed thoughts and feelings. This may include experiencing delusions relating to feelings of guilt. For example, you might become convinced that you've committed a crime. These kinds of experiences can feel very real at the time. This might make it hard to understand that these experiences are also symptoms of your depression. And they can be frightening or upsetting, so it's important to seek treatment and support . You might worry that experiencing psychotic symptoms could mean you’re given a diagnosis that doesn’t feel right for you. But discussing all of your symptoms with your doctor can help you get the right support and treatment.  How might depression affect my day-to-day life? If you have depression, you might find that it interferes with different aspects of your life. For example, it might affect your ability to work, your relationships, or managing your finances. This can add extra stress to an already difficult experience. It may also feel hard to explain your thoughts and feelings to others. You might want to cut yourself off from other people instead. This could lead to you feeling isolated and lonely. If depression is having an impact on your daily life, help is available.  Our pages on getting support at work and organising your finances may also help. It feels like I'm stuck under a huge grey-black cloud. It's dark and isolating, smothering me at every opportunity. Can depression be a symptom of other mental health problems? Symptoms of depression can also be part of other mental health problems, such as: Bipolar disorder. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other personality disorders. Schizoaffective disorder. If you experience low mood or suicidal thoughts, this might be the reason you first speak to your doctor about your mental health. And your doctor might offer you treatment for depression without realising that you also experience other symptoms. If you think you're experiencing other symptoms, you can talk to your doctor about this to make sure you're getting the right treatment."
"What causes depression? There are many ideas about what causes depression. Research suggests that there’s unlikely to be one single cause. The causes can also vary a lot between different people. For some of us, a combination of different factors may cause our depression. Or we may find that we become depressed without an obvious cause or trigger. This page covers some possible causes of depression: Childhood experiences. Life events. Styles of thinking. Other mental health problems. Physical health problems. Family history. Medication. Recreational drugs and alcohol. Sleep, diet and exercise. Is depression caused by a chemical imbalance? The human brain is extremely complicated. Because antidepressants work by changing brain chemistry, some people have assumed that depression is caused by changes in brain chemistry which are then 'corrected' by the drugs. Some doctors may tell you that you have a 'chemical imbalance' and need medication to correct it. But the evidence for this is very weak, and if changes to brain chemistry occur, we don't know whether these are the result of the depression or its cause. Childhood experiences. Research shows that going through difficult experiences in your childhood can make you more vulnerable to experiencing depression later in life. These could include experiences like: Physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Neglect. The loss of someone close to you. Traumatic events. An unsettled family situation. Difficult experiences during childhood can also have a big impact on your self-esteem . And they can affect how you learn to cope with difficult emotions and stressful situations. This could make you feel less able to cope with difficult experiences and lead to depression later in life. Visit our page on support options for abuse to find organisations who can help if you’ve experienced abuse. I first experienced depression at 15, after psychological abuse and domestic violence (both myself and my mother) at the hands of my father, for many years. Life events. Some of us may experience depression after going through an unwelcome, stressful or traumatic event. There are many different types of event that might trigger depression. But some examples include: Losing your job or experiencing money problems. Relationship problems or the end of a relationship. Bereavement. Major life changes, like changing job, moving house or getting married. Being physically or sexually assaulted. Being bullied or abused, including experiencing racism. It's not just negative experiences themselves that cause depression. How we cope with them, and the support we have around us, can also affect how likely we are to experience depression. I started to feel that depression really took a hold after a torrid time in my job, where I was bullied – I just crumbled. Grief and depression Grief is a natural response to losing someone or something we love. This often includes experiencing a low mood. How long this lasts will be individual to you. This period of feeling low is referred to as bereavement . But if you feel that what you're experiencing might be something more than grief, you can talk to your doctor about it. Or you might want to try bereavement counselling. This may be more helpful for you than general support for depression. Cruse Bereavement Support offers support and counselling for anyone affected by bereavement. For me, it started when my mother died. After struggling and burying things deeper, I finally cracked. Styles of thinking. Those of us who experience certain patterns of thinking may be more likely to develop depression. For example, if we tend to blame ourselves for negative events. Or think about the same negative event over and over. If you experience negative patterns of thinking, there are ways to get help. For example, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could help you notice negative patterns of thinking . And it can help you find ways to cope. Other mental health problems. If you experience another mental health problem, it's common to also experience depression. This might be because coping with the symptoms of another mental health problem can trigger depression. You may be more likely to experience depression if you also experience: Anxiety. Eating problems. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Physical health problems. Poor physical health can increase your risk of experiencing depression. Many health problems can be difficult to manage, and this could affect your mood. These may include: Chronic, or long-term, physical health problems. Physical health problems that cause ongoing pain or discomfort. Life-threatening illnesses. Physical health problems that significantly change your lifestyle. There are also some physical health problems that can cause depression: Conditions affecting the brain and nervous system. Hormonal problems, especially thyroid and parathyroid problems. Changes in hormones relating to the menstrual cycle or the menopause. Sleep problems. If you think you have any of these health problems, make sure your doctor knows about them. Some can be diagnosed by having blood tests. If you have treatment for a physical health problem, healthcare professionals may also offer you mental health support. Family history. Researchers have not found a specific gene that causes depression. But research has shown that if you have a close family member with depression, you're more likely to experience depression yourself. This might be caused by our biology. But it could also be because we usually learn behaviour and ways of coping from the people around us as we grow up. It’s likely that our genes, and the environment we grow up in, can both affect whether we develop depression. Medication. Depression can be a side effect of many medicines. The patient information leaflet (PIL) in the packet with your medication can tell you whether depression is a side effect. Or you could ask your doctor or pharmacist about any side effects. If you think medication is causing your depression, you can talk to your doctor about taking an alternative. This is especially if you're expecting your treatment to last for a long time. Recreational drugs and alcohol. Alcohol and recreational drugs can both contribute to depression. Some of us may use them to make ourselves feel better or distract ourselves. But they can make us feel worse in the long term.  Sleep, diet and exercise. Some of us may struggle with sleeping, getting active, or keeping a healthy diet. And if we find these things difficult, it can affect our mood. These things are unlikely to cause depression on their own. But they could make us more vulnerable to it. "
"What treatments are there for depression? This page covers: Self-help resources. Talking therapies. Medication. Other treatments for depression. What happens if medication or therapy aren't working? If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. I really struggled with the SSRIs, even though my GP told me that was the only course of action. They made me feel worse than I did to start with, then incredibly tired. I fought for a referral for CBT and in the end it saved me. Self-help resources. A self-help resource might be the first treatment option your doctor offers you. This is more likely if your depression is less severe. These resources can be accessed faster than other treatments. And they could help you feel better without needing to try other options. Your GP might recommend that you try one of the following: A guided self-help programme. These often focus on how your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and behaviour interact. And they can teach you skills to help you cope with how you feel. A healthcare professional should support you and check your progress through the programme. This support may be online, face-to-face or over the phone. A physical activity programme, such as a group exercise class. These classes are designed for people with depression. Your GP may also be able to help you access other exercise programmes for free or lower cost. Whether you can access this may depend on where you live, and your financial situation. Speak to your GP to find out more about this. Talking therapies. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the following talking therapies to treat depression: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Group CBT. Behavioural activation (BA). Group BA. Group mindfulness-based therapy. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Counselling. Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP). Problem-solving therapy. Behavioural couples therapy – if you doctor agrees that it may be useful to involve your partner in your treatment, because your relationship may be contributing to your depression.  Unfortunately, we know that in many places NHS waiting lists for talking therapies can be very long. Your doctor can talk to you about which options are available in your area. And they can help you find the right kind of therapy for you. Referring yourself to therapy In England, you may be able to refer yourself for therapy via the NHS Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression programme . This was previously known as Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). Visit the NHS website’s therapy finder tool to find a therapy service near you, if you want to refer yourself. Talking things through with a counsellor or therapist really helps me to see things more rationally and make connections between reality and inside my head. Should I stop therapy if I start to feel better? If you're having therapy and start to feel better, this doesn’t mean you have to stop. You can discuss your mood with your therapist and talk about what options might be right for you. For example, NICE guidelines recommend group CBT or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to help you stay well if you've experienced depression in the past. These can help even if you haven't used talking therapy before. Opening up about depression. The more I opened up in counselling, the less of a burden I felt on my shoulders. Read Sam's story Medication. Your GP may offer you medication to treat your depression, such as antidepressants. This is more likely if the depression you’re experiencing is severe. Or if you’ve tried other treatments but they haven’t helped. They might offer medication as a treatment on its own. Or they might recommend taking medication as well as having talking therapy. We have information about the different types of antidepressant: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Tricyclics. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Other antidepressants. In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe lithium alongside antidepressants. This is most likely if you have severe depression, or your depression keeps coming back. And it is usually when you have tried antidepressants on their own and they aren't working. Some of us may also experience psychotic symptoms as part of depression. In this case, your healthcare team may prescribe antipsychotic medication, alongside your depression treatment.  You may find medication that works for you right away. Or you might need to try out a few types of medication before finding one that works for you. Some of us may find that medication isn’t the right treatment at all. You can speak to your doctor about your different options. How long will I need to take medication for? NICE guidelines recommend that you keep taking antidepressants for at least 6 months after an episode of depression ends. But some of us may choose to continue taking medication for a longer period. For example, we may have had several episodes of depression in the past. So we might want to keep taking medication to prevent future episodes. Coming off medication If you're taking medication for depression, it's important not to stop suddenly. Withdrawal symptoms from antidepressants can be difficult to cope with. And for some medications, stopping suddenly can be dangerous. If you decide to try coming off your medication, make sure to: Talk to the person who prescribed the medication, or another health professional who understands the process. Find out the possible risks and how to minimise them. Come off gradually, over a period of time. Whether you continue or stop taking antidepressant medication is usually your decision. You normally have the right to refuse a medication or stop taking it. This is true even if your doctor thinks this might make your depression worse. The situations in which you may not have this right are when: You're sectioned under some sections of the Mental Health Act. You don’t have mental capacity to decide whether to have treatment, and the treatment is in your best interests.  Esketamine Recent research has looked at using a medicine called esketamine to treat depression. This has focused on depression that has not responded to other treatments. NICE guidelines do not currently recommend using esketamine to treat depression. Because of this, doctors are unlikely to prescribe it as a treatment for depression on the NHS. But it is available in some private clinics. Antidepressants have helped to put me in a place where I was more able to cope with counselling. This required a lot of hard work and I had to accept a completely different way of thinking. Other treatments for depression. There are lots of other treatments that you can try to help with your depression. You might try these on their own, or alongside medication and talking therapies. These include: Arts and creative therapies. Complementary and alternative therapies. Mindfulness. Ecotherapy. Peer support. Your doctor may be able to refer you to services offering these treatments. Or you may be able to try some of them yourself. You can also contact your local Mind to find out whether they have any of these available in your area. Taking care of my diet and body, talking and alternative methods work far better for me. What happens if medication or therapy aren’t working? If you've already tried a talking therapy or medication, your doctor may discuss some different options with you. At first, they're most likely to offer you other types of talking therapy or medication . This is in case you can find something else that works for you. But in some cases, there are some other treatments that your doctor may discuss with you. These treatments are rarely used. They are usually only offered if you experience severe depression that has not improved with other treatments: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a treatment that involves sending an electrical current through your brain. NICE guidelines say that doctors should only offer this in certain, rare situations. For example, if you're experiencing a long and severe period of depression and other treatments haven’t worked. Or you’re in a life-threatening situation. If you feel like you're in this situation, you could discuss ECT with your doctor. They should make sure you have clear and accessible information about ECT, so you understand it before deciding whether to have it.  And see our legal pages on consent to treatment and the Mental Capacity Act 2005 for information about your legal rights regarding treatment. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment where your brain is stimulated using magnetic fields. NICE guidelines say that doctors can offer this treatment for severe depression, if it hasn't responded to other treatments. Neurosurgery, VNS and DBS Neurosurgery for mental disorder (NMD) is only performed extremely rarely. Doctors will only offer it if all other treatments have failed. You can never be given neurosurgery without your consent.  There are also similar treatments to NMD, which are reversible. For example, deep brain stimulation (DBS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) . These can be used to treat severe depression, although they are also both performed very rarely. A majority of the treatments I tried were ineffective – but at crisis point, about to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital, I started Interpersonal Psychotherapy and Sertraline. I can honestly say that they saved my life."
"Talk to someone you trust. It might feel hard to talk about how you’re feeling. But many people find that sharing their experiences can help them feel better. Having someone listen and show they care can help in itself. You might not feel like you can open up to someone close to you. But you could call a helpline to speak to someone confidentially. For example you could call Samaritans any time on 116 123 . [What helps is] surrounding myself with friends and family who understand without pointing it out, who treat me normally but recognise that everyday life can be a struggle sometimes. Try peer support. Peer support brings together people with shared experiences, to support each other. Many people find it helps them to share ideas about how to stay well, connect with others and feel less alone. If you’d like to try peer support, you could: Contact a specialist organisation. For example, you can find details of support groups, forums and helplines on the SANE and CALM websites. Join Side by Side, Mind's supportive online community. Contact Mind's Infoline and ask about support groups near you. Or you could contact your local Mind to see if they offer peer support.  Finding a place to fit in. I know that I fit in there. I don’t have to try and be something I’m not, I can just be me. Read Sue's blog Visit a recovery college. Recovery colleges offer courses about mental health and recovery, in a supportive environment. The courses are often designed and delivered by people who have experienced mental health problems. You can find local recovery colleges on the Mind Recovery Net website. Mindfulness does help me with my mental health issues. It's not the cure and it won't work every single time, but it has helped me to alleviate anxiety and depression by centring my thoughts. Try mindfulness. Mindfulness is a way of giving your full attention to the present moment. Some studies show that practising mindfulness can help to manage depression. There are also some mindfulness-based therapies that can help treat mental health problems. For example, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is recommended for managing depression.  R.E.D January transformed the way I manage my depression. If depression is a high-pressure tank, running is the sudden switch of the pressure-release valve. Read Karl's story Take care of yourself. Taking time to look after yourself can help with how you feel day-to-day. This could include making sure you eat and drink regularly and take care of basic hygiene. Or trying to get enough sleep, and going outside each day for some fresh air. If you’re struggling to give yourself this kind of care, it might help to think about how you’d look after someone you care about. For example, a pet or a friend who needs your help. Look after your physical health Experiencing depression can make it hard to find the energy to look after yourself. But taking steps to look after your physical health can make a difference to how you feel: Try to get good sleep. For many of us who experience depression, we might struggle to fall asleep. Or we may find that we sleep too much. But getting good sleep can help to improve our mood and increase our energy levels. You may find it helpful to aim to wake up and go to bed at the same time each day.  Think about your diet. Our page on food and mental health has information about how different types of food and drink may affect how you feel. And it has tips for managing your diet when you’re feeling unwell. Try to do some physical activity. Many of us may find exercise difficult. But even lower intensity activities can help our mood. For example, doing yoga, swimming or walking. If you don't feel confident doing exercise, you could start off with smaller activities and build from there. It may help to begin with gentle stretches or chair-based exercises.  Try to avoid recreational drugs and alcohol. You might feel like using recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings about yourself. But in the long run, these might make you feel worse. And they could prevent you from dealing with underlying problems.  Try to care for your hygiene It may feel difficult to look after your hygiene when you’re experiencing depression. But small things could make a big difference to how you feel. For example, this could be taking a shower, brushing your teeth and getting dressed. If you don’t feel able to do these things, there may be ways to make them feel easier. For example, you could: Use mouthwash instead of brushing your teeth. Use wet wipes and dry shampoo if you don’t feel up to having a shower. Try putting on clean socks and underwear or changing into clean pyjamas, if getting fully dressed feels too hard. Use a fabric spray to freshen up clothes and bedding, if you’re struggling to keep up with doing laundry. You may also find it helpful to create a hygiene kit where you can keep everything you need in one place. This might include things like a toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, a hairbrush or soap. I try to keep active, even if that's just getting out of bed, washed and ready before 10 am, so that the days don't become an endless blur of nothingness. Spend time in nature. Spending time in nature can help with mental health problems like depression. If you’re struggling to leave the house and get outside, opening a window to get some fresh air and sunlight can make a difference. See our information on nature and mental health for more tips. Try something new. Trying something new can help boost your mood. And it can help to break unhelpful ways of thinking or behaving. For example, this could be starting a new hobby, learning a new skill or trying new food. You could do this by joining a group, like a community project, sports team or a hobby group. You could also give volunteering a go. This could help to improve your self-esteem and any feelings of loneliness. Your local Volunteer Centre and the charity Do-It can help you find ways to volunteer. Try to be realistic about what’s possible and avoid putting too much pressure on yourself. Look for an activity you'll enjoy, or something you've always wanted to try. This can help with feeling motivated. Street dancing, depression and me. What turned around my life was getting into street dancing Read Vidura's story Do something creative. Doing something creative can help with managing depression. It doesn’t matter what activity you choose. Some ideas you could try include: Painting or drawing. Colouring. Making a collage. Taking photos. Singing or making music. Dancing. Creative writing. Crafts, such as knitting, embroidery, or making things with clay. Cooking or baking. Keep a mood diary. Keeping a mood diary can help you keep track of any changes in your mood. And it can help you notice if any activities, places or people make you feel better or worse. There are many free diaries available, including from Bipolar UK and eMoods . Write a journal. Writing in a journal can help to process your thoughts and express how you’re feeling. This could be on paper, or in a digital journal. These are some different ideas for keeping a journal: Keep a ‘no filter’ journal, where you write whatever is on your mind each day with no structure or filter. At the end of each day, take note of a few things that went well or that you are grateful for from that day. Write down what has happened during the day, how you've been feeling and what sort of thoughts you’ve been having. This could help you see whether your feelings might be linked to anything you’ve been doing. Make a self-care box. It might help to put together a box of things that can comfort you when you're struggling. For example: A list of your favourite books, films or music. Helpful sayings or notes of encouragement. Pictures or photos you find comforting. A soft blanket or cosy slippers. Snacks or drinks you like. Something that has a nice smell. I've made a list of things I usually enjoy, like knitting or playing the guitar, and I try to do little bits of these activities when I'm feeling low. Mental health apps. There are various apps available that you could use to help yourself day-to-day. But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. Would you like some recommendations? We've put together a library of safe apps that meet our high quality standards."
"How can friends and family help? This information is for friends and family who want to support someone with depression. This page covers: How can I support someone with depression? Tips for starting the conversation. What can I do if they don’t want help? Supporting someone in an emergency. How can I support someone with depression? Support them with getting help You can't force anyone to get help for depression if they don't want it. But you can reassure them that it's OK to ask for help, and that support is out there. Helping them with practical things can also make a big difference. For example, looking into what services are available or taking them to appointments.  Be open about depression Lots of people can find it hard to open up and speak about how they're feeling. Try to be open about depression and difficult emotions. This will help them know that it's OK to talk about what they're experiencing. Speaking honestly and with no judgement can let them know that you’re ready to listen. The best things that friends and family can do is simply listen. They often don't need to say anything, just being willing to listen to your problems makes you feel less alone and isolated Keep in touch It might be hard for them to have the energy to keep up contact. So it can help if you make the effort to keep in touch. It can even be just a text message or email to let them know that you're thinking of them. This could make a big difference to how they feel. Try not to put too much pressure on them to reply. The main thing is that they know you’re there for them. Talking... not even talking about how I felt. Just talking about stupid things that didn't matter over coffee, without pressure and knowing that I can talk about the tough stuff if I want to. Don't be critical You might find it hard to understand why someone can't just 'snap out' of depression. This is especially if you haven’t experienced it yourself. Try not to blame them or put too much pressure on them to get better straight away. They're probably being very critical and harsh towards themselves already. Just a simple call or text asking me how I am helps. I don't want sympathy, just to know they are there if I need them. Find a balance If someone's struggling, you might want to take care of everything for them. And there may be some practical things you can help with, like housework or cooking. But it can also help to encourage them to do things themselves. Everyone will need different support. You could ask what they might find helpful from you. And you could help them identify things they can try themselves. Finding ways of simplifying things they're struggling with can also help. For example, you might help them to set up a regular online grocery shop. Or you could suggest easy meals they could cook in batches and freeze for later. Keep doing things you’d usually do together When someone you know is experiencing depression, it might feel like this becomes the focus of your relationship. But depression is only one aspect of a person’s life. It can help to keep doing other things together. And talk about things that you usually would. For example, if you normally watch TV together, or share a hobby. Take care of yourself Looking after someone else can put a strain on your wellbeing. Remember that your mental health is important too. Try not to feel guilty about taking time to look after yourself. This may feel difficult if you spend a lot of time around someone with depression. For example, if you care for them or you live together. You might feel like you need to be there for them all the time, and put their needs ahead of yours. But it’s okay to set aside time for yourself. And you’ll probably feel more able to support someone if you take care of your own wellbeing. If you're caring for someone, our pages on coping as a carer have information that may help. Carers Trust also has a local service finder for carers’ services that you can search to find support in your area. Tips for starting the conversation. Sometimes it might be hard to know the right thing to say to someone experiencing depression. These are some ideas of supportive things to say: “I’m sorry you’re feeling like this, and I’m here for you.”. “You’re important to me.”. “How are you managing?”. “What can I do to help you today?” Or, if you can, ask something more specific, such as: “Would you like me to come over and keep you company?”. Try to avoid statements like: “Cheer up” or “just think positively.”. “You don’t seem that sad”, or anything that invalidates what they’re going through. “Other people have it far worse than you.”. “You wouldn’t be depressed if you just did some exercise”, or anything that blames them for what they’re experiencing. “You’re being selfish,” or “you should think about how this affects the rest of us.”. Listen carefully, don't judge and most of all, don't say, 'Cheer up.' It's just not that simple. Sometimes solutions are unnecessary, so don't feel you have to provide one. What can I do if they don’t want help? Sometimes, a person experiencing depression may not want to get help, or might not be able to. This may include rejecting any help that you offer. It’s understandable if you feel frustrated, distressed and powerless about this. If you can, try to accept that there are always limits to what you can do to support another person. There are some things you can do: Be patient. You won't always know the full story, and there may be reasons why they're finding it difficult to ask for help. Offer emotional support and reassurance. Let them know you care about them and you'll be there if they change their mind. Let them know how they can seek help when they're ready. For example, you could show them our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem. Look after yourself, to help yourself avoid also becoming unwell. Supporting someone in an emergency. There may be times when your friend or family member needs to seek help more urgently. For example, if they: Have harmed themselves and need medical attention. Are having suicidal feelings, and feel they may act on them. Are putting themselves or someone else at immediate, serious risk of harm. If they’re not safe by themselves right now Help them call 999 for an ambulance and stay with them, if you can. Or you could help them get to A&E. They may appreciate it if you can wait with them until they can see a doctor. If they can keep themselves safe for a little while You can get quick medical advice by contacting NHS 111 in England, or NHS 111 Wales (in Wales, you can select option 2 for urgent mental health support). Or you could help them make an emergency GP appointment to see a doctor soon. You could also suggest that they call Samaritans on 116 123 to talk to someone, 24 hours a day. Or to try another helpline or listening service . It may also help to remove things they could use to harm themselves. This is especially if they've mentioned specific things they might use."
"What is dissociation? Many people may experience dissociation (dissociate) during their life. If you dissociate, you may feel disconnected from yourself and the world around you. For example, you may feel detached from your body or feel as though the world around you is unreal. Remember, everyone’s experience of dissociation is different . Dissociation is one way the mind copes with too much stress, such as during a traumatic event. There are also common, everyday experiences of dissociation that you may have. Examples of this are when you become so absorbed in a book or film that you lose awareness of your surroundings. Or when you drive a familiar route and arrive at your destination without any memory of how you got there. Experiences of dissociation can last for a short time (hours or days) or for much longer (weeks or months). Dissociation may be something that you experience for a short time while something traumatic is happening. But you also may have learned to dissociate as a way of coping with stressful experiences. This may be something that you’ve done since you were young. I felt like my body didn't belong to me, it was like I was an outsider watching my own story unfold. When might I dissociate? For many people, dissociation is a natural response to trauma that they can't control. It could be a response to a one-off traumatic event or ongoing trauma and abuse. You can read more on our page about the causes of dissociative disorders. Dissociation might be a way to cope with very stressful experiences. You might experience dissociation as a symptom of a mental health problem, for example post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder. Some people may dissociate as part of certain cultural or religious practices. You may experience dissociation as a side effect of alcohol or some medication, or when coming off some medication. How might I experience dissociation? Dissociation can be experienced in lots of different ways. Psychiatrists have tried to group these experiences and give them names. This can help doctors make a diagnosis of a specific dissociative disorder . But you can have any of these dissociative experiences even if you haven't been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder. Having difficulty remembering personal information You might: Have gaps in your memory where you can't remember certain events. Not be able to remember information about yourself or your life history. Forget how to do something you’ve been able to do well in the past. Find that you have items that you don't remember ever owning. A psychiatrist might call these experiences dissociative amnesia . Travelling to a different location or taking on a new identity You might travel somewhere and forget how you got there. You may forget important details about yourself and take on a new identity during this time. A psychiatrist might call these experiences dissociative fugue . Feeling like the world around you is unreal You might: See objects changing in shape, size or colour. Feel detached or separate from the world around you. See the world as 'lifeless' or 'foggy'. Feel like you're seeing the world through a pane of glass. Feel like you're living in a dream. Feel as if other people are robots (even though you know they aren't). A psychiatrist might call these experiences derealisation . Feeling like you're looking at yourself from the outside You might: Feel as though you are watching yourself in a film or looking at yourself from the outside. Feel as if you are just observing your emotions. Feel disconnected from parts of your body or your emotions. Feel as if you are floating away. Feel unsure of the boundaries between yourself and other people. A doctor or psychiatrist might call these experiences depersonalisation . Feeling your identity shift and change You might: Switch between different parts of your personality. Speak in a different voice or voices. Use a different name or names. Feel as if you are losing control to 'someone else'. Experience different parts of your identity at different times. Act like different people, including children. A psychiatrist might call these experiences identity alteration . Difficulty defining what kind of person you are You might: Find it very difficult to define what kind of person you are. Feel like your opinions, tastes, thoughts and beliefs change a lot. A psychiatrist might call these experiences identity confusion . What are triggers and flashbacks? A trigger is a reminder of something traumatic from the past, which can cause you to experience dissociation or other reactions. It could be something you hear, see, taste, smell or touch. It could also be a specific situation or way of moving your body. Many different things can be triggers. In a flashback , you may suddenly experience traumatic sensations or feelings from the past. This might happen when you experience a trigger. The flashback might make you feel like you’re reliving a traumatic event in the present. The experience may cause you to switch to another part of your identity. You may experience different identity states with different memories. These may resurface during flashbacks. A flashback is a sudden, involuntary re-experiencing of a past traumatic event as if it's happening in the present."
"What are dissociative disorders? You may be diagnosed with a dissociative disorder if you have regular experiences of dissociation that are distressing. And if these experiences affect your everyday life. Dissociation might also be a symptom of other mental health problems. You can still seek help for this . This page has information on: Dissociative identity disorder. Depersonalisation or derealisation disorder. Dissociative amnesia. Dissociative amnesia with fugue. Other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD). Unspecified dissociative disorder (UDD). Why might it be difficult to get diagnosed? Dissociative identity disorder (DID). If you have dissociative identity disorder you will experience intense changes in your identity. You may feel like different aspects (states) of your identity are in control of your behaviour and thoughts at different times. This can happen in various ways: Each of your identity states may have different patterns of thinking and relating to the world. Your identity states may come across as different ages and genders. You may feel you have one 'main' part of your identity that feels most like 'you'. Some people call this a host identity. The different parts of your identity may have memories or experiences that conflict with each other. Some people refer to these different parts of your identity as alters or parts, and to all the parts together as a system. You might not feel like you have control over when different parts of your identity take over. You may experience amnesia, which means you don't remember what happens when another part of your identity is in control. Do I have multiple personalities? Dissociative identity disorder used to be called multiple personality disorder (MPD). This is because many people experience the changes in parts of their identity as completely separate personalities in one body. In fact, the different parts of your identity are all part of one personality. But it might not feel like they're joined up or working together as a whole. Dissociative identity disorder is the result of a natural way of coping with childhood trauma. Our page on the causes of dissociative disorders has more information. I have many separate, distinct and unique 'parts' of my personality. My 'parts' or 'alters' collectively add up to the total person that is me... They are each a letter, and I am a sentence. Looking after yourself with dissociative identity disorder (DID) DID can make looking after yourself harder. You might find that different parts of your identity have different needs. You may need to use different coping techniques for the different parts of your identity. If something doesn't feel possible just now, you can try something else, or come back to it another time. For more information about coping with dissociation, see our page on self-care . Other dissociative disorders. There are a number of other dissociative disorders. The diagnosis you are given will depend on the symptoms you experience most and how these affect your life. These are the main symptoms or characteristics of each disorder: Depersonalisation or derealisation disorder You might experience regular depersonalisation or derealisation . Dissociative amnesia You might be unable to remember important information about who you are, your life history or specific events. Dissociative amnesia with fugue You might experience a state of mind where you forget everything about who you are (a fugue). In the fugue you may travel to a new location and act like a different person in a different life. Other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD) You might have dissociative symptoms that don't fit into any other diagnosis. The person making your diagnosis will explain why your symptoms don't fit into any other diagnosis. Unspecified dissociative disorder (UDD) You might have dissociative symptoms that don't fit into any other diagnosis. But the person making your diagnosis may not have enough information to make a full diagnosis (for example in an emergency). Depersonalisation: My four months of terror. I now understand that fighting panic only intensifies it. Read Callum's story Why might it be difficult to get diagnosed? You might have symptoms of other mental health problems as well as dissociation. If your doctor is more familiar with these mental health problems, they may only diagnose these problems without realising that you also have a dissociative disorder. Mental health professionals often don't get enough training on dissociative disorders. They might not even think about the possibility of a dissociative disorder when assessing your mental health. This means that they might not ask you the right questions about your symptoms. Understanding more about your life history can help mental health professionals make a diagnosis. But they don't always ask about childhood abuse or trauma at an assessment. Even if they do ask, you may not remember it (if you experience amnesia). Or you may find it too hard to talk about. Some people coping with dissociative symptoms try to keep them hidden from others. It might feel difficult to talk openly about your experiences. What can I do if I disagree with my diagnosis? If your diagnosis doesn't feel right to you, it's important to discuss this with a mental health professional so you can get the right treatment. It may help to ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health professional who knows more about dissociation for a full assessment. If you are not satisfied with the assessment and support you have received from local mental health services, the Clinic for Dissociative Studies may be able to help you. Our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem have information about how to make sure your voice is heard, and what you can do if you're not happy with your doctor. Not everyone finds it helpful to get a diagnosis. Even if you don't get a specific diagnosis, you can still seek help for your symptoms. Can dissociative disorders make people act violently? The media often portrays people with dissociative disorders, particularly DID, as being dangerous or violent. This is a harmful and inaccurate stereotype. See our information on stigma and misconceptions to read more about the myths surrounding violence and mental health."
"What causes dissociation and dissociative disorders? There are many experiences that can cause dissociation. Different experiences might lead us to experience dissociation briefly, or for a longer period. Short-term dissociation. Brief experiences of dissociation are quite common. They can happen to us all sometimes. For example, during periods of intense stress or when we’re very tired. Some people also find that using drugs like cannabis can cause feelings of derealisation and depersonalisation . Dissociation is also a normal way of coping during traumatic events. For example, some people may dissociate while experiencing war, kidnapping or during a medical emergency. In situations we can't physically get away from, dissociation can protect us from distress. Long-term dissociation. Dissociation is a natural response to trauma while it's happening. But some of us may still experience dissociation long after the traumatic event has finished. Past experiences of dissociation during traumatic events may mean that you haven't processed these experiences fully. If you experience trauma in childhood, dissociation may become a way that you cope with this trauma over a long time. Your brain and personality are still developing in childhood, so you may not learn other ways of dealing with other kinds of stress. This may mean you develop a dissociative disorder as an adult. Examples of trauma include: Physical abuse. Sexual abuse. Severe neglect. Emotional abuse. How can trauma lead to dissociation? Experts believe that trauma can cause dissociation because of the way we respond to threat. There are different theories about how this happens. There are a few ways that we might instinctively respond in a threatening situation. You may have heard of the fight-or-flight responses. These are instinctive responses to threat that involve either fighting back against the danger or running away from it. Sometimes you can’t do these things and will respond differently. If you’re very young, or in a situation you can't get away from, your response to the threat may be more passive, such as: The freeze response, which makes the body immobile. You might feel paralysed or unable to move. This response is most often linked to dissociation. Dissociation in humans is like when animals freeze when they’re in danger. The fawn response, which is where you try to please or win over the source of the threat to prevent it from causing you harm. Separating experiences. If you experience dissociation during a traumatic event, you may separate different parts of the experience so you don’t have to deal with them all together. Different aspects of the experience may not feel 'joined up'. Your actions, memories, feelings, thoughts, sensations and perceptions may feel separate. For example, you might store your memories of an experience in a way that you can’t access day-to-day. This is usually called amnesia. You might also remember what happened but not feel the emotions or sensations that were part of it. If you experience dissociative identity disorder (DID), you might feel as if different memories or sensations happened to different people. This is usually called having different identity states. This can help you cope if the things that happened would be too much for you to deal with all together as a child. But it may make it hard for you to develop one clear identity as you grow up. I would disconnect myself from being in the room where the abuse was happening. I almost felt like I was watching it happen to me but I wasn't feeling it or wasn't part of it. It became something that happened automatically. For more support you can contact these organisations: The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) offers support for adults who were abused as children. Survivors UK provides support for men who have been abused. Childline is there to help children who are upset or scared about anything, including abuse. If you are worried about a child you know, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) can help. The Survivors Trust provides contact with local organisations which offer support for people who have experiences sexual abuse.

I had numbed senses, everything was lost, and nothing felt familiar. Read James' story"
"How can I help myself? This page offers some practical suggestions for helping you cope with dissociation, such as: Keep a journal. Try visualisation. Try grounding techniques. Think about practical strategies. Make a personal crisis plan. Talk to people with similar experiences. Look after your wellbeing. Dealing with stigma. Keep a journal. Keeping a journal may help you understand and remember different parts of your experience. It could: Include writing and artwork you do at different times. If you have DID, you may write or make different kinds of art while experiencing different identity states. Help you become more aware of the different parts of your identity. Help you remember more about what happened in the gaps in your memory. Using a journal to express my inner turmoil helps me deal with it. Try visualisation. Visualisation is a way of imagining different scenes and environments. Doing this can help to soothe difficult feelings and thoughts. For example: You might find that imagining you are wearing protective clothing helps you feel more relaxed in stressful situations. It might help to imagine a place that feels safe to you (and your different identity states). When you feel anxious or threatened, you can imagine going to this place for peace and safety. If you experience different identity states, you might be able to imagine a place where they can all meet and talk. Your therapist might be able to help you do this. Try grounding techniques. Grounding techniques can help you feel more connected to the present. They might help you cope with intrusive thoughts or difficult feelings, memories and flashbacks. You could try: Breathing slowly while counting. Tuning into to different sounds around you. Walking barefoot and noticing how the ground feels. Wrapping yourself in a blanket and noticing how it feels around your body. Holding an ice cube or splashing cold water on your face. Touching something with an interesting texture or sniffing something with a strong smell. Focus on the sensations you are feeling right now. You might find it helpful to keep a box of things with different textures and smells. For example, you could include a blanket and some smooth stones. It's strange because it took me a long time to realise that I didn't need to dissociate to keep myself safe. Think about practical strategies. Dissociation can make day-to-day life hard. Practical strategies could help you cope, such as: Wearing a watch with the time and date. Keeping a list of friends and family and their contact details. Writing notes to yourself in the house or on a whiteboard. Make a personal crisis plan. A personal crisis plan is a document you make when you're well. It explains what you'd like to happen if you're not well enough to make decisions about your treatment, or other aspects of your life. Sometimes it's called an 'advance statement'.  Talk to people with similar experiences. Try peer support. Unfortunately, there aren't many peer support groups specifically for people with dissociative disorders. But you can contact First Person Plural for more information, and see our pages on peer support. Or you could try Mind's online peer support community, Side by Side. Read about other people's experiences. If you don't want to talk, you may still find it helpful to read about other people's experiences. This might give you new perspectives or help you find ideas for coping with dissociation. You can read about others' experiences on online forums, like Mind's Side by Side community. Our pages on online mental health have more information about finding ways to connect with other people online. Look after your wellbeing. Try to get enough sleep. Sleep can give you the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences. You might find it helpful to learn relaxation techniques. Our pages on coping with sleep problems and relaxation have more information. Think about your diet. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels. Our pages on food and mood have more information. Try to take some exercise. Exercise can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing. Our pages on physical activity have more information. Depersonalisation, derealisation and dissociation are now only occasional features in my life. But when I am under a lot of stress or not sleeping properly, I find I dissociate more. Dealing with stigma. Unfortunately, some people don't understand much about dissociation and dissociative disorders. And they may hold misconceptions about you. This can be upsetting, especially if the people who feel this way are family, friends or colleagues. It's important to remember that you’re not alone. You don't have to put up with people treating you badly. Here are some options for you to think about: Show people this information to help them understand more about dissociation and dissociative disorders. Talk to other people who have dissociative disorders by going to a support group - or setting one up for yourself. See our peer support pages for more information. Share your experience with others. Mind publishes blogs and video blogs (mental health selfies). Know your rights. Our pages on legal rights provide more information. "
"What treatments can help with dissociative disorders? This page has information on treatments which may be able to help if you have a dissociative disorder, including: Talking therapy. EMDR for dissociative disorders. Medication. Can I recover from a dissociative disorder? Yes. If you have the right diagnosis and treatment, there's a good chance you'll recover. This might mean that you stop experiencing dissociative symptoms. For example, the separate parts of your identity can merge to become one sense of self. Not everyone will stop experiencing dissociative symptoms completely. But treatment can help you feel more in control of your life and your identity. Some people find that being able to dissociate is comforting and may not be ready to stop dissociating completely. Talking therapy. Talking therapies are the recommended treatment for dissociative disorders. Counselling or psychotherapy can help you to feel safer in yourself. A therapist can help you to explore and process traumatic events from the past, which can help you understand why you dissociate. They can also support you in developing new ways of managing your emotions and your relationships. Slowly my other parts are telling me about their memories of my abuse and I'm telling them about my life now and, bit by bit, we're piecing things together and working through it with the help of counselling. Accessing therapy Most talking treatments for dissociative disorders take several years. Unfortunately, the NHS mostly offers short-term or medium-term therapy. This isn't usually effective in treating dissociative disorders. You may need to be very persistent to get the right help from the NHS, or consider alternative ways to access treatment. An advocate may be able to help.  You may also want to seek therapy outside the NHS. You can search for therapists who specialise in dissociative disorders on the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) or British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) websites. Some private therapists offer a 'sliding scale' of fees for those on a low income. If you're on a low income, it’s worth asking a therapist if they have low-cost places available. Choosing a therapist Not all therapists are familiar with dissociation. Some therapists may not have experience of working with trauma. So it may take time to find a therapist who feels right for you. It's absolutely fine to meet with as many therapists as you need to find the one you want to work with. The therapist you choose should be: Accepting of your experience. Willing to work with or learn to work with dissociation and trauma. Be prepared to work with you long-term. Someone who makes you feel safe.  I have learnt ways to control it and have begun to explore my feelings about my past without using dissociation to cope with it. EMDR for dissociative disorders. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) was created to help people process traumatic memories. Standard EMDR is not helpful for most people with dissociative disorders. The treatment should be adjusted to make it safe and effective. EMDR for dissociative disorders focuses on specific memories for shorter time periods. Working in this way helps to prevent too many traumatic memories appearing too quickly, which is sometimes known as flooding. This can make the experience feel less intense. EMDR should only be used when you're feeling reasonably stable and by professionals who know about treating dissociative disorders. Medication. There are no drugs licensed to treat dissociation specifically. Your doctor might offer you psychiatric medication to treat other problems you may experience alongside dissociation. These problems may include depression , anxiety and panic attacks , suicidal feelings , hearing voices and OCD . These medications might include: Antidepressants. Antipsychotics. Mood stabilisers. You'll only be offered medication for dissociative identity disorder (DID) if the dominant parts of your identity experience the problem you want to treat."
"Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD). Some people with dissociative disorders experience seizures. These seizures don't seem to have a physical cause. They're called dissociative seizures or non-epileptic attacks. If you experience these seizures, you may be diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD). Although these seizures don't have a physical cause, this doesn't mean that they're not real or that you're acting. If you have a dissociative seizure you may: Have convulsions of the arms, legs, head or body (on one side or affecting the whole body). Lose control of your bladder or bowels. Bite your tongue. Go blank or stare in an unseeing way. Have other symptoms that look like epilepsy. Dissociative seizures may be caused by the brain dealing with overwhelming stress by 'shutting down'. You can find out more about non-epileptic attacks on the Epilepsy Action website. My own non-epileptic seizures are similar to a tonic epileptic seizure - going stiff and rigid, gasping. This is combined with visual disturbances."
"What can friends or family do to help? This page is for friends and family who want to support someone with dissociation or a dissociative disorder. It can be hard to see someone you care about experiencing dissociation. But family and friends can really help. This page has some suggestions for ways you can support the person you care about, while also looking after your own wellbeing. Try to be patient and understanding in daily life. If somebody you care about experiences dissociation, they may not always respond to you as you'd expect. Ask them what would help. But be aware that they may not always know or be able to tell you. If they want to tell you about their experience, try to listen with acceptance. Touching and intimacy can be difficult for some people. It might help to ask them what's OK and talk about this together. Having understanding family and friends helps me. Think about how to deal with identity alteration. If they experience identity alteration you may have to communicate with different parts of their identity at different times. You may need to develop different ways of managing when different parts of their identity are taking over. It may help to try and find some way of relating to each part of their identity. Try to stay calm. It will help if you can be a safe and soothing presence, even if they're upset, angry or scared. Help them to find the right support. You can: Help them find an advocate and support them to meet with different therapists. Offer extra support and understanding before and after therapy sessions. Help them make a crisis plan if they think it would be helpful. There may be times when you can't offer them the support they need. Think about who's the best person to contact at these times. Have a look at our information on supporting someone to seek help . Think about how you could help keep them safe. Your loved one may have triggers that bring on dissociative symptoms and flashbacks. Understanding their triggers means you can help them avoid them, or feel more prepared for dissociative symptoms when they occur. You may want to offer them support with grounding activities. You could offer to help your loved one figure out what works best for them, and gently remind them to use the techniques they find helpful. If someone you love is hurting themselves or struggling with suicidal thoughts, it can feel really scary.  There might be times where your loved one needs extra help to stay safe. Talk to them about what situations they might need extra support with, and what you can do to help. Look after yourself. It's important to make sure you look after yourself, too. You might find it helpful to find a therapist for yourself. Have a look at our information on talking treatments. Have a look at our information on how to cope when supporting someone else and how to improve your mental wellbeing. It can help to talk to other people with similar experiences.

"On this page: What's the difference between eating problems and eating disorders? What are the signs of an eating problem? How might eating problems affect my life? Eating problems and other mental health problems. What's the difference between eating problems and eating disorders? An eating problem is any relationship with food that you find difficult. An eating disorder is a medical diagnosis. This diagnosis is based on your eating patterns and includes medical tests on your weight, blood and body mass index (BMI).  But eating problems and disorders are not just about food. They can be about painful feelings that you may find hard to express, face or resolve. Focusing on food can be a way of hiding these feelings and problems, including from yourself. Many people think that someone with an eating problem will be overweight or underweight. People might also think that certain weights are linked to certain eating problems. Neither of these things are true. Anyone can experience eating problems - whatever their age, gender, weight or background. I wish people would move away from stereotypes and understand that eating disorders are not only to do with weight, but thoughts, feelings and behaviours – regardless of the number a scale shows, and regardless of physical appearance. What are the signs of an eating problem? Food plays a significant part in our lives. Most of us will spend time thinking about what we eat. Sometimes we might: Have cravings. Eat more than usual. Lose our appetite. Try to eat healthier. Changing your eating habits like this every now and again is normal. But if you feel like food and eating is taking over your life, it may become a problem. There are many ways that eating problems can affect the way you act and think about food. If you have an eating problem, you might be familiar with some of the behaviours listed below. Warning: this list includes descriptions of behaviours to do with food. This can be upsetting or triggering. If you're feeling vulnerable at the moment, you might want to move on to the next section. How might I behave if I have an eating problem? add remove If you have an eating problem, you might: Restrict the amount of food you eat. Eat more than you need, or feel out of control when you eat. Eat regularly in secret or have a fear of eating in public. Feel very anxious about eating or digesting food. Eat in response to difficult emotions without feeling physically hungry. Stick to a rigid set of diet rules or certain foods. Feel anxious and upset if you have to eat something else. Do things to get rid of what you eat, sometimes known as purging. Feel disgusted at the idea of eating certain foods. Eat things that aren't really food, such as dirt, soap or paint. Feel scared of certain types of food. Think about food and eating a lot, even all the time. Compare your body to other people's and think a lot about its shape or size. Check, test and weigh your body very often. Base your self-worth on your weight, or whether you pass your checks and tests. How might eating problems affect my life? Eating problems can affect you in lots of ways. You might feel: Depressed and anxious. Tired a lot of the time. Ashamed or guilty. Scared of other people finding out. You might find that: It's hard to concentrate on your work, studies or hobbies. Controlling food or eating has become the most important thing in your life. It's hard to be spontaneous, to travel or to go anywhere new. Your appearance is changing or has changed. You're bullied or teased about food and eating. You develop short-term or long-term physical health problems. You want to avoid socialising, dates and restaurants or eating in public. You have to drop out of school or college, leave work or stop doing things you enjoy. With other people in your life, you might feel that: You're distant from those who don't know how you feel, or who are upset they can't do more to help. They focus a lot on the effect eating problems can have on your body. They only think you have a problem if your body looks different to how they think it should be. They sometimes comment on your appearance in ways you find difficult. They don't really understand how complicated things are for you. How do I know if I have a problem? As it may feel like part of your everyday life, you might be unsure if your issue with food and eating is a problem. But if your relationship with food and eating is affecting your life, you can seek help. It doesn't matter how much you weigh or what your body looks like. Some people don't seek help because they think their problem is not serious enough. Sometimes they do not feel ‘ill enough’ to have an eating problem. It's also possible to have problems with eating and keep them hidden. Sometimes this can be for very long time. I never looked ‘ill’. When I read about eating disorders it was always girls with acute anorexia. Because that wasn’t me, I felt like my behaviour was just a bizarre quirk I’d made up. Do I have a right to recovery? How do I have a right to recovery if I was never 'really' ill? Read Lucy's story Eating problems and other mental health problems. Many people with eating problems also have other mental health problems. Some common experiences include: Depression. Anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Phobias of certain foods. Issues with self-esteem and body image. Forms of self-harm – you may see your eating problem as a form of self-harm, or may hurt yourself in other ways too. body dysmorphic disorder, which is an anxiety disorder linked to body image. Food is one of many ways in which anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive behaviours can be expressed. My eating disorder has always gone hand in hand with depression and anxiety in such a way that they haven't felt like distinct, discrete illnesses but like one issue. Suicidal feelings. You may have thoughts about death or suicidal feelings . You might feel that you want to die. You might feel that it is the only way to escape your eating problem. This can be very frightening and make you feel alone. You can contact Samaritans 24/7 to get support for these feelings. If you are under 35, you might find it helpful to contact Papyrus . If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency."
"On this page: What is an eating disorder? Bulimia. Anorexia. Binge eating disorder. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Pica. Rumination disorder. Diabulimia. What is an eating disorder? An eating disorder is a medical diagnosis based on your eating patterns. It involves medical tests on your weight, blood and body mass index (BMI). An eating problem means any relationship with food that you find difficult. Not every eating problem will be diagnosed as a disorder. Eating disorders are a diagnosed type of eating problem. Difficulty getting a diagnosis. Getting a formal eating disorder diagnosis isn't always easy. For example: If your problems with eating aren't easy for your doctor to categorise, they might not give you a diagnosis. You may have a very difficult relationship with food which affects your mental health, but doesn't fit into any current diagnoses. You may be experiencing more than one eating disorder, or symptoms from multiple disorders. But understanding feelings and behaviours linked to certain eating disorders can be helpful - even if you don't have a diagnosis. Or if you prefer to consider your experiences in a non-medical way. Body mass index (BMI) and diagnosis. In your assessment, your BMI should not be the only factor your GP or hospital doctor takes into account. Unfortunately, diagnosis and treatment for an eating disorder can be related to your weight. You could have a serious problem with eating, but without meeting the criteria for diagnosis. This can feel very frustrating. However, you should not need an eating disorder diagnosis to get treatment for an eating problem. Usually, your recommended treatment will be for the disorder most similar to your eating problem.  Bulimia. If you get a bulimia diagnosis (known as bulimia nervosa), you may experience a cycle of what's called bingeing and purging. Bingeing is eating large amounts of food in one go. You might do this when you're struggling with feelings or problems in your life. Purging is acting to get rid of the food you have eaten after bingeing. You might feel guilty or ashamed of what you've eaten. Bulimia and your feelings. If you experience bulimia, you might feel: Shame and guilt. Hatred towards your body. That you are fat. Scared of being found out by family and friends. Depressed or anxious. Lonely, especially if no one knows about your diagnosis. Very low, sad and upset. Quick or sudden changes in your mood. Stuck in a cycle of feeling out of control and trying to regain it. Numb, as if feelings are blocked out by bingeing or purging. Bulimia and your actions. If you experience bulimia, you might: Eat lots of food in one go (binge). Go through daily cycles of eating, feeling guilty, purging, feeling hungry and eating again. Binge on foods that you think are bad for you. Starve yourself in between binges. Eat in secret. Crave only certain types of food. Try to get rid of food you've eaten (purge) by making yourself sick, using laxatives or exercising a lot. Bulimia and your body. While experiencing bulimia, you might: Stay roughly the same weight, or experience frequent weight changes. Be dehydrated, which can cause bad skin. Get irregular periods or none at all, if you usually menstruate. Harm your teeth and get a sore throat from stomach acid, by making yourself sick. Develop irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), stretched colon, constipation or heart disease, if you use laxatives. Anorexia. If you get an anorexia diagnosis (known as anorexia nervosa), you’re not eating enough food. This means you're not getting the energy you need to stay healthy. Some people think anorexia is about slimming and dieting, but it's much more complex. At its core, it's often connected to low self-esteem , negative self-image and feelings of intense distress. Anorexia and your feelings. If you experience anorexia, you might feel: Unable to think about anything other than food. Like you need to be perfect or you're never good enough. Lonely, especially if no one knows about your diagnosis. A need for control, that you feel you lose by eating. That you're hiding things from family and friends. That you are fat and scared of putting on weight. That losing weight isn't enough. Like you want to disappear. Angry if someone challenges you about your weight or food intake. Tired and not interested in things you normally enjoy. Like you cannot see a way out, even depressed or suicidal. Anxious or panicky, especially around mealtimes. Like it's an achievement to deny yourself food or over-exercise. I was in so deep with the disorder that I didn’t believe that I could be helped, or even wanted to be. Anorexia and your actions. If you experience anorexia, you might: Reduce your food intake or totally stop eating. Spend a lot of time counting calories of everything you eat. Hide food or secretly throw it away. Avoid 'dangerous' foods, like those with high amounts of calories or fat. Read recipe books and cook meals for others, without eating them yourself. Use drugs that claim to reduce your appetite or speed up digestion. Spend your time thinking about losing weight, checking and weighing yourself. Exercise a lot, with strict rules about how much you must do. Develop very structured eating times. Make up rules about food – for example listing 'good' and 'bad' types or only eating certain colours of food. I started starving myself as a means of control. Everything else had been taken out of my control, but no one could force me to eat. I'd enjoy and crave the feeling of my stomach being... empty. Anorexia and your body. While experiencing anorexia, you might: Weigh less than you do normally, or should do for your age and height. Lose weight very fast. Become physically underdeveloped, especially if anorexia starts before puberty. Feel very cold and weak. Move around more slowly than normal. Have irregular periods or none at all, if you usually menstruate. Lose your hair or start to have very thin hair. Develop fine fuzzy hair on your arms and face, called lanugo. Lose interest in sex, or find you're not able to have or enjoy sex. Find it hard to concentrate. Develop fragile bones or problems like osteoporosis – this is a disease that makes your bones break easily. Binge eating disorder. If you get a diagnosis for binge eating disorder, you might feel unable to stop eating, even if you want to. With binge eating disorder, you might rely on food to make you feel better. You might also use food to hide difficult feelings. It is sometimes described as 'compulsive eating'. Binge eating disorder and your feelings. If you experience binge eating disorder, you might feel: Out of control. As if you can't stop eating. Ashamed of how much you eat. Lonely and empty. Very low, even worthless. Unhappy about your body. Stressed and anxious. Binge eating disorder and your actions. If you experience binge eating disorder, you might: Eat large amounts all at once (bingeing). Eat without really thinking about it, especially when doing other things. Often eat unhealthy food. Eat for comfort when you feel stressed, upset, bored or unhappy. Eat until you feel uncomfortably full or sick. Hide how much you are eating. Find dieting hard whenever you try it. I dread any event with a buffet. Because I know I'll eat and I'll keep eating and I won't even enjoy it but I'll eat because I feel somehow I have to. I'll eat even when I'm feeling full, when I'm feeling bloated, feeling pain in my gut, feeling sick. Binge eating disorder and your body. While experiencing binge eating disorder, you might: Put on weight. Feel sick a lot. Have shortness of breath. Get sugar highs and lows, which means having bursts of energy then feeling very tired. Develop health problems, such as acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Develop problems linked to being overweight – for example type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or joint and muscle pain. Binge eating disorder: it felt momentous to have a calm, ordinary conversation about it. The first GP I told was clueless. But another GP encouraged me to tell her more, and I learnt about the help I could get. Read this story Other specified feeding and eating disorder (OSFED). If you get an OSFED diagnosis, you have an eating disorder. You may experience any feelings, actions or body changes linked to other eating disorders. But you don't meet all the criteria for anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder. This doesn't mean that your eating disorder is less serious than others. OSFED just means that your disorder doesn't neatly fit into current diagnoses. Getting a diagnosis of OSFED can help you access treatment and support. Previously, OSFED was known as ‘eating disorder not otherwise specified’ (EDNOS). For more details, see Beat's information about OSFED . I was assessed by my local eating disorder service and was given a diagnosis of EDNOS. I managed to get my eating back on track. I continue to work on the feelings with the help of my therapist and am very much in recovery. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). If you get a diagnosis of ARFID, you'll strongly feel the need to avoid certain foods (or all foods). This might be because of smell, taste or texture. The idea of eating may fill you with anxiety. ARFID does not tend to be linked to body image issues. It's more anxiety about the process of eating itself. For more details, see Beat's information about ARFID . My eating disorder has never been about body image or control, and I've had it for as long as I can remember. When I'm faced with certain foods I feel a reaction in the pit of my stomach like someone has put a plate of the most disgusting things in front of me. I can only equate the sensation to walking past an open sewer. Pica. If you get a diagnosis of pica, you'll often eat things that aren't food. The things you eat tend to have no nutritional value. Some examples may be chalk, metal or paint. This can be very damaging to your body. For more details, see Beat's information about pica . Rumination disorder. If you get a diagnosis of rumination disorder, you'll regularly regurgitate your food. Regurgitating means bringing food back up that you've already eaten and swallowed. You won't have a physical health problem to explain it. You might re-chew, re-swallow or spit out the food you regurgitate. For more details, see Beat's information about rumination disorder . Diabulimia. Diabulimia is something that can affect people with type 1 diabetes. It is a term for when you deliberately restrict or stop taking your insulin to control how many calories your body absorbs from food. ‘Diabulimia’ is not a formal medical diagnosis, so your doctor might not know about it. But it is a term that some people with type 1 diabetes use to describe this experience. Some people also use the term ‘T 1 ED’ or 'T 1 DE', which is short for ‘type 1 diabetes with an eating disorder’. You may hear this used to describe living with type 1 diabetes and experiencing an eating disorder, including restricting your insulin. Restricting your insulin can be very dangerous , or even life-threatening . So it is important to get support. The charity Diabetes UK has more information on diabulimia and diabetes , and where to turn for help."
"On this page: Traits of people with eating problems. Difficult life experiences. Family issues. Social pressure. Physical and mental health problems. Biological and genetic factors. Triggers or 'at risk' times. My eating problem was a response to difficult changes happening to me and the questions of identity these changes raised, but was also set against a backdrop of bullying, poor mental health and low self-esteem throughout my time at school. Traits of people with eating problems. People experiencing eating problems often share common traits. Certain traits may make you more vulnerable to developing an eating problem. Some common traits include: A desire for perfection. Rarely being satisfied with what you've done. Being very critical of yourself. Being overly-competitive about things. Obsessive or compulsive behaviours (see our pages about obsessive-compulsive disorder). A lack of confidence in expressing yourself. Difficult life experiences. The start of your eating problem may be linked to a stressful event or trauma in your life. Some examples are: Physical, emotional or sexual abuse. Serious family problems. The death of someone close to you. Pressures at school or work, such as exams or bullying. Abuse and eating problems I want to explain how being a victim of abuse has been the cause of my current eating disorder. Read Georgie's story Eating problems often develop at the same time as you're going through major life changes such as: Starting puberty. Changing school or university. Starting a new job. Exploring your sexuality. Leaving home or moving to a new place. My eating problem began when I was younger and was bullied a lot. I lost my appetite through stress and felt like people would like me more if I was thinner and seemed more in control. I associated eating with feeling like I was losing control. Eating problems in pregnancy or after having a baby. When you're expecting a baby it's natural for your body and nutritional needs to change. But if you have mental health problems, or have had eating problems in the past, this can be a difficult experience. Some people find that eating problems can get worse during this period. Find out more about eating problems and pregnancy from Tommy's , the midwife-led charity. Family issues. Researchers aren't sure how much family issues lead to eating problems. Most agree that family is just one of many things that could affect how likely eating problems are. Some research suggests that eating problems may be more likely if your home didn't feel safe or stable when you were a child. But there is little research to show that specific family issues cause eating problems. For example, coming from a very protective or inflexible family. You may feel that your family was significant in your experience of eating problems. Or you may feel that other factors have been more important. I had issues with my eating when my parents split up. It was the only part of my life that I felt like I could control, and I craved that control as everything else spiralled.​ Social pressure. Social and cultural pressures probably don't cause eating problems. However, they can contribute to them and help to keep them going. We're surrounded by messages about body image through films, magazines, social media and adverts. This can give us unachievable ideas about how we should look. You might not be aware of it, but you may be comparing yourself to unrealistic images. As a result, this type of social pressure might: Make you feel that you are not good enough. Have a negative impact on your body image and self-esteem. This world is full of images telling us we’re not worthy of a beach unless we look a certain way. The biggest act of rebellion is to like yourself, in spite of those voices telling you you’re not good enough. Social media and eating problems. Images of ‘perfection’ can be hard to avoid if you use social media. But try not to compare yourself or anyone else to these images. Be aware that before posting photos online, people commonly make use of: Apps which allow them to alter parts of their face or body. Filters which can make them appear to have flawless skin. Camera angles, lighting and photo editing tools to improve their overall appearance. Try to remind yourself people post photos on social media that are often edited to look better than reality. It can feel difficult, so sometimes taking yourself offline for a while might help.  You can also use social media in a positive way in your recovery. Read more on the Beat blog – Eating Disorders and Social Media . Physical and mental health problems. If you have physical or mental health problems, you may also develop eating problems. If you have a physical health problem, this can sometimes make you feel powerless. You may use eating or exercising as a way to feel more in control. Or an eating problem might begin because you experience a mental health problem. Some examples include: Depression. Anxiety. Bipolar disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Your eating problem can also cause mental health problems such as those listed above. It could also be linked to feelings of low self-esteem , worthlessness or powerlessness. I suffer from depression and anxiety in relation to my eating disorder and it is suspected that I also have borderline personality disorder too. Biological and genetic factors. Research has shown that genes and biology may impact your chance of developing an eating problem. We all have brain chemicals that control hunger, appetite and digestion. It has been found that some people with eating problems seem to have different amounts of these. The brain chemical serotonin can affect your mood and appetite. Some people have too much or too little of this. Some hormones control hunger and feeling full. Some people may be more sensitive to these, which could make them more likely to overeat or binge. Triggers or 'at risk' times. Some things, although not the cause of your eating problem, could help to prolong it. You might be coping with recovery at the moment, or have had eating problems in the past. Try to be aware of certain things that can make your eating problems more likely to come back. Some people call these triggers or 'at risk' times. For example, you may find talking about food and dieting with friends triggering. It might be helpful to learn what your triggers are, so that you can try your best to avoid them. The stress of being somewhere new and unknown aggravates my illness."
"This page has information about recovering from an eating problem, including: Dealing with misconceptions. Coping with other people's comments. Coping with putting on weight. Difficult times of year. It also has some tips for taking care of yourself if you're living with an eating problem: Talk to people you trust. Seek peer support. Learn how to manage relapses. Change unhealthy routines. Take care online. Look after yourself. Recovering from eating problems. Recovering from eating problems means different things to different people. It might mean that you never have thoughts or behaviours related to your eating problem again. Or you might still experience thoughts and behaviours, but not as often. They might also have less impact on your life. The way you perceive your relationship with food, and your views on recovery, might change over time.​ You might sometimes feel: That you don't have a problem. That your behaviours are in fact helpful to you. That your eating problem feels comforting, safe or even exhilarating. Scared of the changes that come that will with recovery. Whatever recovery feels like to you, it can take a long time to get there – even when you feel ready to try. You may have to think in years rather than weeks and months. Recovery can seem scary if you feel: Afraid of losing or putting on weight. Anxious about losing control. That your eating problem is a big part of your life and identity, so you're not sure who you are without it. If you have tried to recover before, or have relapsed, you might start feeling like you're completely beyond help. But it is possible to feel better, even if it takes a long time. For more information, see our page on treatment and support for eating problems . You can also watch our animation about recovering from an eating disorder. This includes tips for taking care of yourself, finding support and coping with difficult feelings. I started to use what I had been through to strengthen myself. I knew that I could be determined, motivated and achieve what I put my mind too. I wanted to flip the anorexic energy into the recovery process. Dealing with misconceptions Many people wrongly think that only young women can experience eating problems. Because of this, it might feel hard to share your experiences if you're older or you identify as male. Remember, anyone can have eating problems. You may also find your body changes at a different rate to your mental health. As you start to look healthier, you may feel worse. Other people may think you have recovered when you're still finding things very hard.​ It can help to keep talking about how you feel, with people you trust. Coping with other people's comments Not everyone around you will understand what it's like to have an eating problem. Some people may comment on your body, your weight, how much you eat or what you eat. People might think they're saying something positive to help you. But they might not realise that it can be difficult for you to hear. This can be really hard to cope with – what helps or hurts is different for everyone. It might help to try and explain to family and friends how you feel. Describe to them what a more helpful or supportive response would be. You can't always stop people from saying unhelpful things. It could be a good idea to think about how you will deal with the things people might say. I’ve met a lot of people who want to help, but find it really hard to understand how. Read Eleanor's story Coping with putting on weight Recovery does not mean putting on weight for everybody. But for some people this is incredibly challenging to live with. Some people have found these tips have worked for them: ​Write down the reasons why you want to recover and look at them when things feel difficult. Take all of your clothes that don't fit to a charity shop, or sell them online. Treat yourself to some new clothes in sizes you feel confident in. Try not to spend too much time looking in mirrors or checking your body. Avoid weighing yourself if possible. Write down all the healthy physical changes that are happening in your body. Talk to other people – have a rant or share your worries with someone who understands. Try not to make comparisons or spend too much time looking at pictures of people in magazines or online. Remember that these pictures are often filtered or photoshopped. I built myself a first aid kit of things I could turn too when I needed the encouragement to keep going. I put things in it like bucket lists, letters from those important to me, photos, future goals, phone numbers, achievements, sensory objects and distraction techniques. Difficult times of year There are certain times of year that might trigger difficult thoughts and behaviours. Often these are celebrations that revolve around food and eating with others, like Christmas​ and birthdays. Talk to someone you trust about how you feel and what might make things easier. If possible, find alternative ways to celebrate. Think about things you can do to look after yourself when you are finding things hard. Acknowledge and accept that there might be times where you feel out of control. Be gentle with yourself and don't set your expectations too high. You might have a bad day on Christmas Day and as awful as that feels, you’ll get through it. Read Olivia's story Ramadan and eating problems If you are Muslim you may find that Ramadan causes conflicts between your faith, your eating problems and recovery. You might find that fasting triggers thoughts and behaviours related to your eating problem. Especially if you're praised for eating very little. Others find that eating with family and friends during iftar makes them feel out of control. Although you may be excused from fasting if you have a medical problem, this may make you feel guilty. Other people may not understand why you are not fasting. Read Habiba's blog on the Beat website about​ eating disorders and Ramadan . Self-care for eating problems. These self-care tips can help to live with your eating problem day-to-day, and with your recovery. Talk to people you trust Eating problems can feel very difficult to talk about for many reasons. People close to you may find eating problems hard to understand, but will often want to help however they can. The eating charity Beat has tips for talking to others about your eating problem . If you are finding it hard to talk, try writing things down. For example. you might find writing a letter helps you set out your thoughts more clearly. You might find it helpful to show people our pages about eating problems to help them learn more. You are always the most important person in your recovery. If you find positive relationships in others radiate off of these, laugh with them and mirror them. Seek peer support Eating problems can make you feel ashamed, isolated and misunderstood. It can really help to talk to people who are going through something similar. You can look for peer support online or face-to-face. These organisations can help you find peer support for eating problems: Beat. Overeaters Anonymous. Student Minds. Side by Side (Mind's online peer support community).  Learn how to manage relapses It's very common to go back to your old thoughts and behaviours. Especially around times when you feel stressed. Try to identify situations when you might be more at risk of your eating problems returning. Some examples could be: When you gain or lose weight. When your body changes shape. Going on a diet. Going on holiday. During pregnancy and after giving birth. Stressful times like exams, important events, going through a break-up or moving house. Think about your warning signs. Try to learn what you can do to prevent things from getting worse. Early warning signs could be: Eating too much or too little. Making pacts with yourself about food or eating. Feeling like you want to purge. Thinking about food all the time. Checking your body more. Weighing yourself more. Most people will have setbacks in their recovery. But after each setback you may find you understand more about yourself and your eating problem. It's important to try and be gentle with yourself. Try to accept relapses as part of a long, but achievable, process of change. As long as I was still taking baby steps, i.e. occasionally trying a small piece of something new that wasn't too dissimilar to things I already ate, then I was still working towards better health. Change unhealthy routines Routines around eating and food can be hard to break. But you might find that making small changes can help. For example: Buy smaller amounts of food if you are worried about overeating. Try to distract yourself whenever you find yourself focusing on your body and weight. It can help to try a new hobby or interest that takes a lot of concentration. Find fun things to distract yourself after meals if you are worried about purging. Try to think of some positive goals that are not related to food or calories. I do better with buying food in single servings so I only have around what I’m intending to eat there and then. Take care online If you have an eating problem you may find that you spend a lot of time comparing your body to other people's, sometimes without even really realising you are doing it. We are often surrounded by pictures and images – especially on social media . Be aware of how you feel when you are online and adjust the places you visit and the people you follow if you need to. It is ok to take a break from social media, or to adjust your lifestyle, so that this plays less of a part in how you spend your time. Remember that many pictures have been manipulated to make the person look different. Pictures on social media may have been filtered or photoshopped. Think about how you deal with pictures of yourself. Do they make you feel bad or do you feel you need to change them to hide how you really look? Think about whether you are following anyone whose pictures make you feel bad or trigger problematic thoughts. Unfollow them if you can. Block or avoid any websites that promote eating disorders. Look for positive communities around eating, recovery and body positivity. The idea of being wrenched from my daily food pattern was incomprehensible. Read Juliette's story Look after yourself Try to be as kind to yourself as you can. For more ideas, have a look at our pages on: Relaxation. Mindfulness. How to improve your mental wellbeing. I just feel confident with where I am in my recovery that I can fight it. Read Hope's story"
"On this page: Talking to your doctor. Online self-help programmes. Talking treatments for eating problems. Medication for eating problems. Admission to a hospital or clinic. Note: this page covers recommended treatments for anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder. You may get a diagnosis of other specified feeding and eating disorder (OSFED). Or you may not get a diagnosis at all. Your doctor should offer treatment for the diagnosis that most closely matches your symptoms. You shouldn't need a diagnosis to get treatment.  Talking to your doctor. Talking about your eating problems can feel scary. But to access treatment, the first step is usually to talk to your GP or hospital doctor. They should then be able to refer you to specialist services.  My main piece of advice is to go to the doctor. I did, eventually. Doctors are nice people. They listen and understand and try their hardest to help. Online self-help programmes. In some cases, at first you might get support through an online self-help programme. This might be offered to you initially if: You get a diagnosis for bulimia. You get a diagnosis for binge eating disorder. The symptoms of your eating problem are similar to either of the above. You should receive short support sessions alongside the programme. These may be face-to-face or over the phone. If you find the programme hard to complete, or find it unhelpful, ask your GP for more support. Talking treatments for eating problems. Like some other mental health problems, you might be offered talking treatments for eating problems. The following treatments are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). It produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare.  Cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED). This form of CBT is specifically adapted to treat eating disorders. It may be offered for anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder. For anorexia, you should be offered up to 40 sessions. You should have twice weekly sessions in the first two or three weeks. For bulimia, you should be offered at least 20 sessions. You may be offered twice weekly sessions at first. For binge eating disorder, you should be offered group CBT sessions at first. If you'd prefer individual therapy or find the sessions unhelpful, tell your therapist or doctor. Cognitive behavioural therapy really helped me to change the distorted thoughts flying around my head and move on from my eating disorder. Family therapy. Family therapy means working through issues with your family and the support of a therapist. It's commonly offered to people with anorexia, especially younger people. You might explore situations that could relate to underlying issues of your eating problem. It can help your family understand your eating problem and how to support you.  The hospital also gave my family an opportunity to attend family counselling in which they learned how best to support me. Accessing talking treatments. You can access talking treatments through the NHS. Your GP should be able to make a referral. But be aware that there can be long waiting lists on the NHS. Because of this, some people also consider private therapy. For private therapy, you have to pay for appointments. Some options include: Finding a private therapist through the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). Private therapy isn't an option for everyone because of the cost. You could try to access free counselling services and support groups from Beat (the eating problems charity). See also our page on useful contacts for eating problems . Talking treatments for anorexia. If you get an anorexia diagnosis, you may be offered some additional talking treatments. Maudsley Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA). This helps you work towards recovery by helping you understand what keeps you attached to anorexia. Gradually you can learn alternative ways of coping. This should be done at a pace that suits you and your needs. You should be offered at least 20 sessions. Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM). This is not purely a talking treatment, but talking treatment can be included. You'll have weekly meetings where you receive support for weight gain, physical health, education and advice. You'll also have a chance to talk about key issues you're experiencing. It can help you think more about your symptoms and behaviour. Focal Psychodynamic Therapy (FPT). This treatment aims to help you understand how your eating habits are related to what you think, feel about yourself and others. Usually, this is only offered when you find that other treatments aren't right for you. I dreaded the thought of group therapy but the experience of hearing others talk about their problems really resonated with me. Medication for eating problems. There are no specific drugs to treat eating disorders. However, you may be offered medication for underlying factors such as depression or anxiety . For example, you may be offered an antidepressant to help manage these feelings. You should be offered medication alongside talking treatments . Medication shouldn't be the only thing you're offered. Your doctor will decide whether to offer you medication – you can decide whether you want to take it. If your eating problem means you're underweight, drugs are absorbed more quickly into your bloodstream. This could make any medication more harmful, or not as effective, as it should be.  Admission to a hospital or clinic. You may need to go into a hospital or clinic because of your eating problem. This might be necessary if: Your doctor or care team feel you are very unwell or underweight. Other kinds of treatment haven’t worked. Your home environment is making it hard for you to stay well. How long do I have to stay? If you're an outpatient or day patient, you will go home most evenings and weekends. If you're an inpatient, you will stay in the hospital or clinic for most of your treatment. How long you are admitted for will depend on how much help you need to recover. What support and treatment can I get? You'll normally receive a range of support as an inpatient. The staff at the hospital or clinic could include: Doctors. Dieticians. Psychotherapists. Occupational therapists. Social workers. Family and relationship therapists. Specialist nurses. Treatment can include: Talking therapies. Medication. Refeeding. Working in groups with others experiencing eating problems. Your weight and general health will be monitored for the duration of your stay. You may also get guidance on: Buying, preparing and serving food. How to cope with stress and anxiety. How to be more assertive. How to manage anger and communicate well. With the daily routine, support system, classes and therapy I was able to start to rationalise anorexia’s thoughts and slowly become stronger. What is refeeding? Refeeding means being given food to bring your weight up to a healthy level. It involves helping you to gain weight so that your energy levels and physical health improve. You may be given certain foods for their nutritional value. Or foods that are particularly good at helping people gain weight. Refeeding varies from one clinic to another. Some doctors may do this over a period of time, allowing you to gradually increase your weight. Others will want to help you back to a healthy weight as soon as possible. This can be a distressing process, especially if you do not want to gain weight. It may be something to discuss with your GP or hospital doctor in more detail. What if I don't live near a clinic? There are only a few NHS eating disorder clinics. So you may not always be able to access treatment close to where you live. This could mean going to a clinic further away, or going to a general mental health hospital. Ask your GP or care team if you’d like to know more about specialist clinics. There are also private treatment centres. Some may offer similar treatment to NHS clinics. Others have a wider range of complementary and art therapies. Try using Beat's HelpFinder tool , which is a directory of available services. Could I be forced to go to hospital? You could be forced to go to hospital under the Mental Health Act . This is often known as 'being sectioned'. You can be sectioned if your own health or safety is at risk, or to protect other people. Before being sectioned, you will be assessed by health professionals. You could be sectioned for your eating problem if, for example: It has a significant negative impact on your own health or safety. You won’t be able to recover without medical support. Your mental health might get worse. If you are sectioned, you may also be treated against your consent during your stay in hospital. Treatment against your consent for an eating problem could involve refeeding , for example. For more detailed information, see our legal pages on sectioning . Saying goodbye to anorexia. It took everything I had to fight those thoughts and admit I needed help – but I did. Read Nicole's story"
"On this page: First steps towards support. Learning how to understand them. Practical ways you can help. Tips for your own wellbeing. First steps towards support. If someone you care about has an eating problem, you might: Feel very worried about the person. Find it hard to know how to talk to them about it. Find it difficult to know how to deal with changes in their mood. Have tried to offer support, but found that they're unwilling or unable to accept help. You might be feeling powerless, frustrated and angry. But a good place to start is just to show the person you're here for them. Try to be considerate of the following: Let them know you are there. Make sure the person knows you’re here to listen and can help them find support. This is one of the most important things you can do. Let them know they can talk to you when they're ready. Try not to get angry or frustrated. They might already feel guilty about how their behaviour is affecting you. Try to be as understanding and patient as you can. Don't make assumptions. Try not to interpret what their eating problem means without listening to them. This could add to their feelings of helplessness. It could also make them less able to share their difficult emotions and seek support. Avoiding common assumptions Many of us assume that eating problems are linked to certain behaviours, or physical traits. You might assume that: Eating problems are mainly about body image. You can tell what eating problems someone has from their appearance. Young women are the only group who experience eating problems. But none of these assumptions are true. Anyone can experience eating problems. This is regardless of age, gender, weight or background. For people with eating problems, dealing with misconceptions is a difficult part of the experience. People never seem to understand what it is. I've had it said that I'm 'scared of food', or that it's not really a disorder – that I'm 'just being fussy' – both of which really trivialise how it feels for me. Learning how to understand their feelings. You might be finding it hard to understand the person's eating problem. This can also make it hard to be accepting towards how they might feel. Or how your attitude or behaviour might make them feel. Try thinking about the following: Be patient with them. Remember that their own acceptance of the problem can take time. It can take a long time for them to accept it and seek help. They might not see their eating as a problem. They could see it as a solution to cope with certain feelings. For example rage, loss, powerlessness, self-hatred, worthlessness, guilt, or feeling like they have no control. They may be scared about what recovery means for them and their body. Be gentle with them. You can't force someone to change their behaviour. You might try hard to persuade, trick or force someone into eating more or less. This could make them feel even more anxious and fearful about food. It could also make them withdraw from you. They might try harder to convince you they're eating more healthily, even if they're not. Don't focus or comment on their appearance. Remember that someone's weight or appearance doesn't tell you how they're feeling inside. With some comments such as ""you look well"", you think you're being kind. But they can trigger very difficult feelings for someone who has an eating problem. The eating problem charity Beat has more information on how to talk to someone with eating problems. ...but you look fine to me? People often look me up and down, with puzzled expressions on their faces, before announcing, 'well, you don't look ill to me'. Read Nicole's story Practical ways you can help. As well as developing your own understanding, these practical ideas can help the person you're worried about. You could try the following: Include them in social activities. If they find it difficult to eat, arrange activities which don’t involve food. You could watch a film, play a game or take a walk. Keep meal times as stress-free as possible. Don't comment on their food choices. Let them get on with eating the food they feel able to eat. Find safe ways to talk about it. Some people find it helps to refer to the eating problems in the third person. Try saying things like ""that's not you, that's the eating problem speaking"". Help them find good information and avoid bad sources. This could mean looking for reliable facts and trusted online support. It also means helping them avoid places online that may promote unsafe eating and exercise habits. Share stories from other people. It can be really helpful to read stories and accounts by people with eating problems. Especially those who are ready to think about recovery. You can find some by looking in the 'Eating problems' category of the Mind blogs and stories. You can find more stories and blogs at Beat. Encourage them to seek professional help. If they are worried about talking to their doctor, you could offer to go along with them.  Our useful contacts for eating problems lists charities and other organisations they can contact. Family therapy for eating problems If the person is a member of your family, you might attend family therapy as part of their treatment. Family therapy means working as a family to: Explore what might have prompted the underlying feelings. Better understand everyone's emotions and needs. Find ways to move forward together and support the person. You can find a family therapist by asking your GP or hospital doctor for a referral. You can also look for a therapist via the Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice . If family therapy isn't right for you (or isn't available), it can still help to discuss what is happening with your family. She would drive to my sixth form college everyday to help me eat. She wouldn't push me or tell me to eat, she would just sit there patiently and be with me at that difficult time in the day. She would also be with me as I had panic attacks after meals. Tips for your own wellbeing. It's important that you manage your own wellbeing while supporting your friend or family member. Try to do the following if you can: Remember that recovery can be a long process. While their body might look healthier quickly, they may be finding things hard emotionally. Relapses are common and don't feel very encouraging. It helps to accept this as part of the process. Don't blame them, yourself or anyone else. Try to be kind to yourself. Supporting someone with an eating disorder can be upsetting and exhausting. It's important to remember that your mental health is important too, and you deserve support for yourself as well. For for information, see our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else and helping someone seek help. Seek support from specialist organisations. Depending on your relationship to the person, there may be dedicated support options. You might find it helpful to look into the Young Minds Parents Helpline and Beat's Support for Carers. Mental illness, my Dad and me It was a huge sacrifice on my Dad’s part as he gave up a lot of aspects of his life. Read Tilly's story"
"What are voices? 'Hearing voices' means hearing a voice (or many different voices) when no one is present with you, or voices that other people with you can't hear. People have many different experiences of hearing voices. You might not mind your voices, or even find them comforting and helpful. You might find them irritating or distracting. Or they might feel frightening and intrusive. Your feelings about your voices may be different at different times. This could depend on how you're feeling, what's going on in your life or what types of voices you hear. It's common to think that if you hear voices, you must have a mental health problem. But research shows that many people hear voices and don't have a mental health problem. It's quite a common human experience. I hear hundreds of voices... relatives, friends and people in the media. Why do I hear voices? There are lots of reasons why you might hear voices. Here are some of them: Voices as you fall asleep or wake up – these might happen when you're half-asleep, because your brain is still partly in a dreaming state. The voice might call your name or say something brief. You might also see strange things. These experiences usually stop when you're fully awake. Poor sleep – sleep problems may cause you to hear voices. Hunger – you may hear voices if you're extremely hungry. Physical illness – if you have a very high temperature you may hear voices or see things that other people can't. Hearing voices can sometimes be a sign of other illnesses. If you're concerned about this, it's important to speak to your doctor. Drugs – you may hear or see things after taking recreational drugs or as a side effect of some prescribed drugs. You might also have these experiences when you're coming off drugs. Stress or worry – you may hear voices while feeling very stressed, anxious or worried. Bereavement – if you've recently lost someone very close, you may hear them talking to you or feel that they are with you. This experience is very common and some people find it comforting. Abuse or bullying – you may start hearing voices after being abused or bullied. This may include hearing the voice of someone who abused you. You may hear them being unkind or threatening, or telling you to harm yourself. Other traumatic experiences – you may hear voices as a result of other traumas, which can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and with dissociative disorders. Spiritual experiences – some people hear a voice as part of a spiritual experience. This may be a very special experience that you feel helps you make sense of your life. Or you may feel as though you are hearing the voice of an evil spirit. Mental health problems – you may hear voices as a symptom of some mental health problems, including psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder or severe depression. Hearing voices with bipolar disorder. ""When I was younger I thought having someone who talked to me in my head was normal."" Read Katie's story Talking to other people. It can be hard to talk about hearing voices. The way other people react can make a big difference to your experience. You may feel able to cope with your voices but find that other people’s reactions are more of a problem. You might feel that you need to hide what your voices say or how often you hear them. It may be difficult to be around others if your voices are distracting you. Or you may find your voices harder to manage in some social situations. You might find that other people: Give your voices meanings or assume that your voices mean you are seriously ill. Don't mind about your voices and accept them as part of who you are. Don’t understand what hearing voices is like, which can be frustrating. Get frustrated if you’re distracted by your voices. Talking about your voices with someone you really trust might help you feel more comfortable. If you're worried about their reaction, you could show them this information. I didn't want to talk about it because that would somehow make it more real. Facing stigma and misconceptions. Unfortunately, some people have misconceptions about what it means to hear voices. They might think that hearing voices means you're dangerous or very unwell. This can be upsetting, especially if the people who feel this way are family, friends or colleagues. Our culture or religion can impact how we experience or describe our voices. Some professionals may not be aware of cultural differences in understanding voices. This may make it more difficult to find support that reflects your own understanding of your experiences. Our information on racism and mental health has more details about inequality in the mental health system, including suggestions for overcoming barriers to support. If your friends, family or wider community hold negative views about what it means to hear voices, you might feel afraid to tell anyone about it or ask for help. This might increase your stress levels and make the voices more distressing. It's important to remember that you're not alone. You don't have to put up with people treating you badly.  My journey to recovery wasn’t easy. I was faced with stigma and discrimination by so many people."
"Experiences of hearing voices. Your experience of living with voices is unique to you. But this page explores some situations, questions and feelings you might recognise. What kinds of voices do people hear? Your relationship with your voices. Difficult experiences of voices. What kinds of voices do people hear? We may hear voices in lots of different ways and they may change over time. These are just some of the ways that different people might experience hearing voices. Where might they come from? You might: Experience the voices as coming from inside your head. Feel that voices are coming from outside and heard through your ears like other sounds. Hear the voices as if they're right next to your ear. Hear the voices coming from an object or animal. Feel as if you are hearing other people's thoughts, or as if other people can hear your thoughts. When might I hear them? You might: Hear your name called when there's no one with you. Hear or see things as you're falling asleep. Hear voices when you feel stressed or upset. It often happens when I’m in bed and can’t sleep, but it has happened during the day too. What might they say? You might: Experience nasty or threatening voices that tell you to do dangerous things, or try to control you. Hear a voice that feels friendly but encourages you to do things that might not be good for you. Hear a kind supportive voice or a voice that helps you. Hear many voices talking about you or arguing with each other. Hear a voice describing what you're doing as you're doing it.

I remember hearing this malicious whispering which I assumed was coming from other passengers on the train... it was like being able to hear people's thoughts and in my paranoid state these were always malevolent and critical. Your relationship with your voices. You may have different feelings about your voices at different times in your life – or even at different times of the day or week. You might: Find your voices comforting, helpful or funny. Find your voices frightening, distracting or upsetting. Want your voices to stop. Find you hear some voices that you like and other voices that cause you problems. Worry that you are the only one who hears voices, or that no-one else hears the sorts of voices that you hear. Often voices are a problem because of your relationship with them, rather than just because you hear them. Thinking about your relationship with your voices can help you work out what (if anything) you want to do about them.  What if I like my voices? Some people can find hearing voices a positive experience. Your voices might be friendly and supportive. You may welcome them or miss them if they stopped. They might make you feel better or encourage you during difficult times. Can I trust my voices? It might be hard to work out if your voices want the best for you or not. They might feel friendly but tell you to do things that make it hard for you to look after yourself. Or stop you doing what you want to do. If your voice feels comforting, it can be hard to recognise that it's saying manipulative or harmful things. Difficult experiences of voices. You might find your experience of hearing voices difficult for a few reasons: My voices are harder to deal with at specific times You might only hear voices at certain times of the day (for example, at mealtimes). Or even at certain times of year (for example, at the anniversary of a particular event or experience). You may only hear voices in certain places. For example, you might hear voices when you leave the house or when you go to a place which you associate with stress or trauma. You may find that your voices are louder and more frequent when you feel stressed. This may mean you avoid certain places or experiences – or find them very difficult. I don't feel able to control my voices You may feel that your voices are controlling you or stopping you from doing things that you would really like to do. Your voices might interrupt your thoughts and make it very difficult to concentrate or hold a conversation. Your voices might say things that you find offensive or that go against your values. This can feel shameful or embarrassing, making it harder to tell others about what you're experiencing. I had an interview... I left the house and the whispering started, growing steadily louder until I eventually fled home drenched in sweat and absolutely terrified. I feel threatened or upset by my voices Your voices might: Be unkind to you, and criticise and undermine you. Tell you to do things that are wrong. Demand that you hurt yourself. These experiences are likely to make you upset, scared or angry. You might feel that you deserve to be shouted at, or that it's hard to stand up to anyone. They would constantly tell me that bad things were going to happen, that my loved ones would be killed, or I’d be attacked."

What was happening when I first heard voices? Where was I? How was I feeling? What did they say? What did they sound like? What age were they? Do they represent a person or problem? Are there any patterns to the voices? You may recognise voices as people from your past or as your own voice at different ages. They may be related to traumatic or painful experiences. Voices and your life now These questions might help you think about voices in your life now. Do I hear voices at a particular time or place? What is happening when I hear voices?

Here are some things you could try: Stand up to them. Tell them they have no power over you. Ignore their commands or threats. Tell them you’re not going to listen to them or do what they say.

Here are some things you could try: Ask them: ‘What do you need?’ Trying to understand them may help you feel more in control. Remember where the voices come from.

Tell them that you understand, but you're not going to listen to them right now. Practise treating your voices very kindly. It may feel hard at first, but after time it can become more natural. Be kind to yourself. Try not to judge yourself if your voices are saying things that you find disgusting or offensive. What they're saying isn't a reflection of who you are. React neutrally to your voices Sometimes, reacting neutrally to voices can be the most helpful way to communicate with them. Here are some things you could try: Acknowledge what the voices say without agreeing or disagreeing with them. Use neutral phrases to reply to them.

I can negotiate and wait before acting on instructions and try grounding techniques to distract myself. Communicate in your own way There's no right or wrong way to communicate with your voices. Here are some things you could think about: Try to ignore the voices you don't like and focus on the ones you find easier to listen to. You might want to speak aloud to your voices. Or you might find it easier to write things down. Start slowly and take your time. Different voices may call for different reactions. Some may be easier to challenge, and some may be better to ignore. It might help to use creative methods to explore your voices, such as journalling.

Some people find listening to music, audiobooks or podcasts a helpful way to distract from voices. It might help to use headphones. Use a grounding object. Keep a small object with you to hold and focus on when you feel bothered by your voices. For example, you could use a stone, a fidget toy or a piece of fabric.

If someone you care about hears voices you might find it hard to understand what they're experiencing. You might not know how to help. But there are lots of positive things you can do to support them. Accept that their experience of the voices is real. Everyone will have a unique experience of hearing voices. You can help by accepting their experience as real - even if you find it hard to understand. Try not to make judgements about what hearing voices means for them. Some people don't talk about their voices because they're worried their friends and family won't understand, or will assume they're seriously ill. Learn their triggers. Ask if there are certain situations or experiences that trigger their voices. Remember that they're still the same person. Hearing voices doesn't change who they are. My family and friends didn't judge me which I think made it a lot easier for me to deal with. Ask them what would help. Try not to make assumptions about what they find difficult. People may want different support at different times. Sometimes it's just best to ask how you can help. Reassure them that they're not alone. Lots of people who hear voices don't realise that other people do too. It may also help to remind them that hearing voices does not always mean that they're ill. There are lots of reasons why people hear voices. Encourage them to talk about their experience. This might mean talking with you. Or they may want to talk to a doctor, support worker or other people who hear voices. Focus on feelings. Ask them how their voices make them feel, rather than what they're saying. The content of voices can be very personal, so try to reassure them that they only need to share what they’re comfortable with. Eventually I did confide in one of my closest friends. He told me without any drama that it was a fairly normal reaction to a highly stressful situation. Try not to take things personally. It can be hard to focus on conversations if you’re hearing voices. Try to be patient if they seem distracted or say that they need some time alone. Help to distract them. Try suggesting activities or tasks, such as watching a film, going for a walk or cooking a meal. Learn more about the experience of hearing voices and help challenge stigma. Start with our pages about hearing voices and experiences of hearing voices. Help them seek treatment or support if they want it.  But remember that not everyone who hears voices will want, or need, treatment or support. Take care of yourself. Looking after someone else may affect your own wellbeing. "

"About hoarding. To give you an introduction to hoarding, this page covers: What is hoarding? Other types of hoarding. Hoarding and other health problems. Effects of hoarding. Hoarding and stigma. What is hoarding? Hoarding is having so many things that you cannot manage the clutter where you live, and find it difficult or impossible to throw things away. You might hoard because you feel a strong need to keep things. But your connection to these things can cause you distress. And the impact of hoarding can affect your day-to-day life. Hoarding disorder is a mental health problem that a doctor can diagnose. But you might also experience hoarding as part of another mental or physical health problem. If you hoard, you might: Feel the need to get more things, even if you have a lot already. Have very strong positive feelings whenever you get more things. Feel very upset or anxious at the thought of throwing or giving things away because of your emotional attachment to them. Find it very hard to decide what to keep or get rid of. Find it hard to organise your things. Have so many things that you can't use parts of the place you live in – like not sleeping on the bed or using the sink. Have lots of disagreements with the people close to you about your things. Find it hard to pack for trips away, like a holiday – you might pack many more things than you really need, because you can't decide what's important. I tried to throw away things that I found on the floor, but couldn't because of emotional attachment. Whether it be for practical, sentimental or aesthetic reasoning, I couldn't do it. Why might I hoard? Many of us have belongings we consider special and things we save. But this is different from hoarding. When you hoard, it's because you might have emotional connections or beliefs about all your things. This makes it very hard to get rid of anything. For example, you might believe the following: You need to keep items 'just in case'. Even if it's been a long time since you last used the item or if you've never used it at all. You'll forget important information or memories if you throw things away. You won't cope with how you'll feel if you throw things away. Throwing things away will harm other people or the environment. If you throw anything away, you are being wasteful. You should arrange or dispose of things perfectly, or not at all. Your things make you feel happy or keep you safe. Your things are all unique and special, even if they're very similar. You simply need more storage space, or more time to sort your things out. Lots of us share some of these beliefs about certain belongings. But we don't feel as strongly about them. And we don't experience these beliefs and feelings as part of hoarding. How is hoarding different from collecting? The main difference between collecting and hoarding is: How you organise the items. How much it affects your life. Collecting normally involves saving certain types of items, such as vinyl records or stamps. You'd carefully choose them and normally order them in some way, such as in display cases or folders. Hoarding is not normally as selective. It doesn't involve organisation in a way that makes the items easy to access or use. Someone who doesn't recognise they have a hoarding problem might call themselves a 'collector'. They might not see their behaviour as any different to collectors. Other types of hoarding. Hoarding does not only involve keeping objects in the place you live. There are other types which you might not recognise as hoarding at first. But they can make you feel the same way, for the same reasons. Digital hoarding Digital hoarding is when you make and keep a large number of digital files. Deleting files can cause you the same distress that other people who hoard might feel around physical objects. And you may want to keep these files for similar reasons. It might involve buying multiple hard drives and devices, or using cloud storage or other software to keep the files. The types of files can include: Photos and videos. Documents, such as Word files or spreadsheets. Emails. Texts or chat messages. You might experience digital hoarding on its own, or along with hoarding physical objects. You might keep a digital record of things you hoard physically. For example, by typing up an index. Digital hoarding might start out as a way to reduce physical hoarding. For example, you might start taking pictures of objects instead of buying them. But you might end up causing similar problems as physical hoarding. I had reasoned with myself that taking photos would not help because I would be creating five objects not just one, whether it be digital or physical, if not both. Animal hoarding Animal hoarding is when you keep too many animals to provide proper care for. You might have trouble noticing that this lack of care causes harm to the animals. This could include the animals not having: Food. Shelter. Enough space to exercise and stay healthy. Vets or medical care. Clean environments. Safe breeding environments. To class your behaviour as animal hoarding, you don't need to have a set number of animals. It's more about how you get the animals and how you care for them. You might experience animal hoarding on its own, or alongside other types of hoarding. Some of us might experience delusions , such as beliefs that animal rescue centres harm animals or can't look after them. The reasons behind hoarding animals are very complicated. Those of us who hoard animals can often: Believe very strongly that we are saving the animals or have a duty to look after them. Have a very strong emotional connection to all the animals. Find it difficult to see that we are harming them, which can be very hurtful when people tell us we are. If a vet or animal welfare organisation believes the animals are at risk of harm, they might take the animals away. This can be very upsetting. The courts can also be involved sometimes. If you need legal advice in these situations, you might be able to get help from the Law Centres Network . The RSPCA offers information on how different animals should be cared for . Hoarding and other health problems. Hoarding can be a symptom of other physical and mental health problems. It's important to know if another health problem is behind hoarding, as this can affect the treatment . Some health problems that might lead to hoarding include: Brain injuries. Dementia. Depression. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Schizophrenia. Personality disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Alcohol or drug addiction. Prader-Willi syndrome (a genetic condition). In these cases, treating the physical or mental health problem may stop you hoarding. Normally, you won't get a diagnosis of hoarding disorder if your hoarding is caused by another health problem. Because of this, not all of our information on hoarding might be helpful to you. After a divorce and house move, as a single mum working full-time suffering from depression on and off for years, I didn't have the energy to face throwing things away, especially baby clothes and toys, and my small flat became increasingly full. Is hoarding the same as OCD? You can experience both obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and hoarding disorder at the same time. But experiencing hoarding disorder does not mean you have OCD . They are two different conditions. In the past, doctors used to think that hoarding was a type of OCD. But since 2015, doctors consider hoarding disorder as its own, unique mental health problem. Because of this past cross-over, some OCD organisations still offer information on hoarding disorder. Effects of hoarding. Hoarding could affect you in lots of different ways. For example, you might: Struggle to find things you need. This can sometimes lead to money problems, for example if you can't keep on top of bills and letters. Avoid letting people into your space or have difficulty answering the door. This could mean you don't have visitors or get repairs done, which could lead to housing problems. Find it hard to keep yourself clean. For example if you can't access your bathroom or washing machine. Find it hard to cook and eat food. This might be because you can't access your kitchen or there's no room inside your fridge. Be unable to use parts of your space. For example being unable to sleep in your bed or walk along hallways because they're very cluttered. Be unable to quickly and safely leave in an emergency. For example, because your things are blocking doorways or escape routes. Distance yourself from others or have issues with people close to you. This might be because you don't want them to know about your situation, or because they say or do things that don't feel helpful to you. Feel ashamed or lonely. This could make you feel very isolated or affect your self-esteem. You might also experience many of these effects if you live with someone who hoards . I stopped asking people round as I was ashamed and it caused me a lot of guilt that I was not hosting family meals. My family wanted to 'help' by turning up with bin bags but this caused more upset. Hoarding and your rights Official organisations might get involved if the things in your home, and the way you've organised them, cause safety risks to you or your neighbours. This could involve: The local council, including the Environmental Health department. Fire and rescue services. Social services or safeguarding teams. The courts. Animal welfare teams, if you hoard animals or have animals that are at risk due to hoarding. These teams might suggest things that you aren't comfortable with. In some cases, they might remove you or your belongings from your home – even if you don't want them to. But remember: you have rights in these situations. For advice on your rights, contact our legal line . For legal support, contact the Law Centre Network . Hoarding and stigma. Many of us have heard of hoarding, but this doesn't mean that we all understand it. The word 'hoarding' is sometimes used in the wrong way, such as: The media referring to panic buying as hoarding. This can happen during natural disasters or events like the coronavirus pandemic. People calling themselves 'hoarders' because they collect items or have more clutter than usual. The media might also show hoarding in a very extreme way, which is different to many experiences. This can make it difficult to recognise that you're hoarding or tell other people about your experiences. People might also make hurtful assumptions about hoarding, such as thinking it means being unclean or lazy. Hoarding doesn't mean you need help tidying up – it's unhelpful if people try to do this for you. It can feel frustrating and upsetting if people don't understand this. but it's important to remember that you are not alone . For more information, see our pages on stigma and misconceptions . I'm a hoarder... It is a constant internal fight that I live with, that nobody sees. Read Kate's story"
"Recognising hoarding. This page covers: How do I know if I'm hoarding? What kind of things can I hoard? What if I don't know I'm hoarding? Can I get a diagnosis of hoarding disorder? How do I know if I'm hoarding? Some of us who hoard do not know we are hoarding or cannot see how it impacts our lives. It can feel very stressful if other people tell you that you're hoarding. This might come from friends, family, your partner, or official bodies like the council. While hoarding, you might: Only realise you are hoarding when other people are in your space. Not be able to tell you're hoarding – sometimes called 'clutter blindness'. Realise that it's affecting your life, but find it hard to stop or know how to change. For more information, see our pages on helping yourself and treatments. Hoarding normally starts in the place you live. But you might expand or use other spaces such as a car, garage or storage unit. You may also keep things at other people's homes, if they allow you to. Realising that there was a problem was my first step, and doing something about it was the next. By talking about my journey to decluttering I hope to raise awareness for others that there is help and hope out there. What kind of things can I hoard? Everyone will have a different experience of hoarding. It's possible to hoard anything, physical or digital. These are some examples of things that people commonly hoard: Clothes or shoes. Drawings or photographs. Toys or childhood keepsakes. Books, newspapers, magazines or leaflets. Post (open or unopened), bills or other paperwork. Boxes, bags or other storage containers. Food, including rotten or out-of-date food. Digital files, such as emails or photos. Broken items, which you might have kept and planned to repair. Animals, such as cats or dogs. You might save things other people see as worthless or of limited value. You might have important and unimportant things mixed up together – such as important bills mixed with old newspapers. This might cause you distress, or it might be how you prefer to arrange your belongings. I kept lots of clean packaging as school kept asking for stuff for junk modelling, and I liked to do crafts with my daughter. Slowly things built up and my dining table was completely covered, so we could not actually do the craft stuff. What if I don't know I'm hoarding? If you're unsure about whether you have a hoarding problem, you could do the following: Make an appointment to speak to your GP. Contact the organisations in our useful contacts. Use tools from The International OCD Foundation to help identify a hoarding problem, such as image ratings and questionnaires. You may want to take these to a GP to discuss if you're unsure how to use them. You might feel someone close to you has a hoarding problem they aren't recognising. For more information, see our page on helping someone who hoards . My mum sleeps on a small patch of her sofa. I don't know the last time she slept in a bed, but it has been several years. Can I get a diagnosis of hoarding disorder? If you experience certain symptoms, doctors or healthcare professionals may give you a diagnosis of hoarding disorder. They might also call it compulsive hoarding. Your doctor might give you a diagnosis of hoarding disorder if you: Find it difficult to get rid of things you own, even if they aren't worth anything. Feel emotionally distressed at the thought of getting rid of things – and that you need to save them. Can't use parts of your home because they're so cluttered. Keep bringing home things you've bought or got for free, even if you have no space or use for them. Experience distress due to hoarding or find it's affecting other areas of your life, such as your relationships with friends and family. Experience hoarding on its own, not because of another health problem. It's important to remember that hoarding disorder can be different for everyone. You might recognise some of these signs and symptoms, but you might have other experiences or difficulties. Research has shown that many people who hoard show these signs in their teenage years. But doctors won't normally diagnose hoarding disorder unless you've got large amounts of clutter in the place you live. This doesn't usually show until you are a bit older. It might not happen until you have your own space, or you've gathered items over a long period of time. Because of this, it can be hard to recognise the signs of hoarding early."
"Causes of hoarding. No one knows exactly what causes hoarding, but there are lots of theories. Different people will have different reasons for their own experiences. It's likely to be a combination of factors. This page covers: Difficult feelings. Perfectionism and worrying. Childhood experiences. Trauma and loss. Family history or habits. Difficult feelings. Hoarding can be related to difficult experiences and painful feelings. You may find these hard to express, face or resolve. Some people say hoarding helps them cope with other mental health problems, or distracts them from feeling very anxious, upset or afraid. There can sometimes be a link between hoarding and impulse control. This is when you find it almost impossible to resist certain actions, such as buying items. Perfectionism and worrying. If you hoard things, you might feel very worried about making mistakes – also known as perfectionism. You might also find it hard to make decisions, plan ahead or work out how to do tasks. These could be possible reasons why some of us are more vulnerable to hoarding. For example, you might struggle to sort or group your things into types, or to decide what to keep or throw away. The idea of this might seem so difficult or upsetting that it feels easier not to try. Sometimes I get triggered because I have anxieties about society's expectations of what I should be doing or achieving. Childhood experiences. Some researchers believe hoarding can relate to childhood experiences of losing things, not owning things, or people not caring for you. This might include experiences like: Money worries or living in poverty in childhood. Having your belongings taken or thrown away by someone. Hardship, emotional abuse or neglect. For example, if your basic needs weren't met, or people didn't treat you with warmth or support. These experiences might make you feel more connected to your belongings, or make it hard for you to organise them. My parents were full of stories of their parents' and grandparents' deprivations, it was part of my world view growing up, and I know that chronic disorganisation multiplies the impact of every extra item I have. Trauma and loss. You might be able to link the start of your hoarding to a traumatic period in your life. This could include: Being abused, bullied or harassed, including experiencing racism. Breaking up with a partner. Experiencing physical health problems. Losing someone close to you. Feeling extremely lonely or isolated. Experiencing long periods of stress, or feeling stressed a lot. For some of us, these experiences could make your hoarding worse if you started doing it before a traumatic period. It was like she built a wall of stuff to keep everyone out. Having experienced several traumatic events in her life: the loss of her baby (while her father was dying), a terrible divorce, her partner having a heart attack and finally the death of her mother. No-one could hurt her if she was protected by all of this stuff. Family history or habits. It's common for those of us who hoard to have family members who share this behaviour, such as a parent or sibling. Some studies suggest that certain genes could make you more vulnerable to hoarding. But family links are very complicated. If you grew up around hoarding, you might have learned some of these habits and behaviours. You could also hoard without any other family members who have problems with hoarding. If you live with someone who hoards , this can result in you having more clutter in your home overall. You might find it really difficult to make changes because you disagree with each other on what to keep or throw away. I call my mum a hoarder because she is, I just had no idea that I'd become one too. I thought of my childhood and the shame I felt that my house wasn't like my friends' houses."
"Helping yourself with hoarding. Living with hoarding problems can be difficult. But there are things you can do to help yourself cope. This page has some suggestions for you to consider. Not all of these suggestions might work for you – it's OK if you need to try a few things before you find what works best . This page covers: Starting to manage your hoarding. Staying motivated. Coping with difficult feelings. Keeping yourself safe. Helping others understand. Starting to manage your hoarding. It's not unusual to feel overwhelmed if you're trying to cope with a hoarding problem. You might feel like helping yourself will be too hard or take too long. And if you don't know where to start, taking small steps can help you make good progress. For example: Set yourself small goals. Try something like throwing away one thing per day. Set a timer and try to tidy one area. Or you could limit the time in other ways, like listening to a set number of songs. Make a plan. For example, you might schedule one hour a week for cleaning. Try to plan where your items will go, such as in the bin or as a donation. As soon as possible, try to make sure they go exactly where you planned. Cancel things like magazine subscriptions or put up a 'no junk mail' sign. This might help to stop new things coming into your home. Come up with some rules. Some people use the rule that if they haven't used an item in the last year, they'll get rid of it. Different rules work for different people, but these can help to make decisions easier. Explore new activities that don't involve buying or saving things. This could be going for a walk, watching a film or visiting a museum. You could also talk to people close to you about gift giving. Try to agree on ways of giving gifts that don't involve physical objects, like having a meal out. I started to try to declutter, and it really wasn't easy. I spent days crying, trying to find something that I could part with to get the ball rolling. Eventually I managed to make a start, and it felt great. The more floor I could see the better I felt. Staying motivated. You might have been trying to manage your hoarding problem for a while, but sometimes feel like you're getting nowhere. Because of this, you may find it difficult to stay motivated. Some of these tips might help you keep motivated and notice how far you've come: Find ways to track your progress. You could try taking before-and-after pictures of the space you've decided to clean. This can help you see how much progress you've made. Make things easier for yourself. This might include using a litter-picking tool to pick things up without touching them, or starting with an area you find easier to clear. Find support for related issues. If you're experiencing other issues alongside hoarding, it might help if you look into support for these. This could take some pressure off you. You might be able to find help in our pages on money worries, addiction and housing problems. Celebrate your wins. Try going out with friends or watching a TV show you like when you have achieved any goals – no matter how small they may seem. Ask for help. You may have someone close to you who could help you. Sometimes just having someone to talk to before or after you clear can feel useful. If you feel you need more practical support, you might want to contact the organisations in our useful contacts . And if you experience difficulties with hoarding, you may be entitled to a needs assessment by social services. For more information, see our pages on social care . In the last four years I have kept my snail's pace progress going by getting motivation from YouTube, listening to lectures on hoarding psychology and decluttering, and seeking help on self-help forums. Coping with difficult feelings. Trying to manage your hoarding can make you feel emotionally drained. It might bring up lots of difficult feelings, which can make handling practical tasks harder. There are ways you can support yourself and get help for these feelings. For example: Talk to someone. You might find it hard to open up about hoarding, but it might help if you share how you're feeling. If you don't feel you can talk to people around you, contact some of the organisations in our useful contacts. Try peer support. Connecting with people with similar or shared experiences can be really helpful. For information on where you can find this sort of support, see our pages on useful contacts and peer support. Keep a diary. Try noting down your moods and feelings, as well as keeping a note of your hoarding. This could help you spot patterns in what triggers your hoarding behaviours, and the reasons behind difficult feelings. Take time to relax. Trying to manage your hoarding can be very hard work – emotionally as well as physically. It can help to find ways to relax that don't involve getting or saving things. For more ideas, see our pages on stress, relaxation and nature. Try to take care of yourself. Try to get enough sleep and do enough physical activity to look after your general wellbeing. It's a big step to recognise that you might have a hoarding problem and need some help. Even if you're finding it hard, knowing you're working towards change is something to be proud of. Sometimes I'll just write on an online forum to vent how angry I am at myself... Yes anger and depression are closely enmeshed in my clutter, and squalor. I can be furious at myself for being in such an awful mess, and can end up telling myself that I don't even deserve to have a decent home. Keeping yourself safe. Hoarding can sometimes make the place you live less safe. You might have a higher risk of fire spreading, or it may be hard for you to leave in an emergency. You might not feel ready to start dealing with other parts of your hoarding problem. But it can be beneficial to make sure the place you live in is safe. For example: You can ask your local fire service to do a safety check. Many fire services understand hoarding. They might ask you to describe your situation using the Clutter Image Rating. The London Fire Brigade has a fire safety checker tool, which could help if you're concerned about fire safety. Age UK also has information on safety at home, which might help older people in particular. Helping others understand. You might disagree with people around you when it comes to hoarding. This could be friends, family, your partner, or official bodies like the council. It might be because they: Say you have a hoarding problem, but you don't think you do. Insist on helping you clean, but you don't want them to. Cannot see that you have made progress. Do not believe you can keep up the progress in the long term. It can feel very upsetting to hear these things from people close to you. To help them understand your situation a bit better, try showing them our pages for friends and family and talking about a mental health problem . Official bodies like the council or a housing officer might say things you disagree with. Find out about your rights by speaking to our legal line or reading our information on discrimination ."
"Treatment for hoarding disorder. If you feel distressed by hoarding, you might want to consider seeking treatment. A growing number of mental health professionals are aware of hoarding disorder. They should know that they need to help you take things at your own pace. And they should not pressure you to make changes faster than you want to. This page covers: Talking to your GP. Talking therapies for hoarding disorder. Medication for hoarding disorder. Talking to your GP. The first step when seeking help is usually to visit your GP. If they think you're experiencing hoarding disorder, they might refer you to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional. They will assess you and might look into whether there are any other health problems related to your hoarding. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare – hasn't issued treatment guidelines for hoarding disorder. But the guidelines for treating OCD mention hoarding because OCD and hoarding used to be grouped together . These guidelines advise that: You should be offered evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Healthcare professionals should consider offering you treatment in the place you live, which some people find helpful. If you can't attend appointments or have visitors, your doctor should also consider treatment over the phone. For more information about talking to your GP, see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem . Tools to help you talk to your GP There are also some tools to help you start a conversation about hoarding disorder with your doctor: Hoarding ice breaker tools. Filling in a hoarding ice breaker form could help you to talk to your GP. You can download a copy from the website Rainbow Red. It can help you explain how hoarding affects you. Clutter Image Rating tool. Using this tool involves looking at pictures and choosing which ones most closely match your situation. You can download a copy from Hoarding Disorders UK. You may also be able to find a free app by searching your app store for 'Clutter Image Rating'. Not everyone finds the Clutter Image Rating tool useful. It might not properly reflect the size or type of place you live in, for example if you live in a caravan. You might also have some other symptoms of hoarding disorder but not yet have a home that is very cluttered. It's OK if the Clutter Image Rating does not work for you. Talking therapies for hoarding disorder. The main talking therapy used to treat hoarding disorder is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behaviour. Evidence suggests that both individual and group CBT can help. It also suggests they're more likely to help if you follow a programme designed for hoarding disorder – rather than OCD, for example. Hoarding-specific treatments are improving as researchers learn more about what can help. Together with your therapist, you might: Examine your beliefs about needing to keep things. Try to understand why it's hard for you to get rid of things. Learn skills to help you cope with difficult feelings. Other types of talking therapy may also help you, but experts need more research to find out what could work best. For more information, see our pages on talking therapies and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . There are a variety of therapies that have together helped to support me and more importantly, allow me to understand why and how I became a hoarder, so I am able to change my responses. Therapy in the place you live Research suggests that it can help if your therapist visits you in the place you live. This way they can understand more about your situation and help you work out how to make changes. Some people also find it helps to have treatment in a familiar environment. As part of the course, we were also each given a 'declutter buddy'. Initially, the idea of someone coming into my home filled me with terror and dread, but as soon as my buddy, Ebi, arrived I felt calm and safe. Ebi helped me on a practical level as well as an emotional level. Long-term therapy You might need a long-term CBT approach to help manage your hoarding disorder. It can take a long time to feel comfortable and take steps to address your hoarding. But unfortunately, in most regions the NHS only offers short-term or medium-term therapy. You may need to be very persistent to get the right help from the NHS, or consider other ways to access treatment. An advocate may be able to help you. For more information, see our pages on advocacy and making yourself heard . If you can afford it, you can also seek private therapy outside the NHS. You can search for therapists who specialise in hoarding disorder through the: UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP). British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). For more information, see our page on private therapy . Medication for hoarding disorder. There aren't any specific medications for hoarding disorder. But some people find medication helps with other problems they experience alongside hoarding. Your doctor might offer medication if your hoarding is a symptom of another health problem . Medication really helps some people but isn't right for others. Before deciding to take any medication, it's important to have all the facts you need to make an informed choice. For more information, see our pages on things to consider before taking medication and your right to refuse medication . For guidance on how to come off medication safely, see our pages on coming off medication . To be honest my recovery probably would not have started without medication. The anxiety and depression needed to be sorted out a bit before the house could even start to be sorted."
"Helping someone who hoards. This section is for friends, partners or family members who want to support someone who is hoarding. You may feel very worried if you think someone you care about is hoarding. It might feel difficult to know how to talk to them about it, especially if they don't agree that they are hoarding. You might have already tried to offer support, but the person you're worried about is maybe unwilling or unable to accept help. This can feel really difficult, worrying or frustrating. But there are lots of helpful things you can try. We offer suggestions for ways you can support them while also looking after your own wellbeing. Do not consider forced clear-ups. If you're supporting someone who is hoarding, it's understandable that you want to help them clear up. And you might believe you're doing them a favour if you clean and tidy things for them. But this is very unlikely to help in the long term – and it could make things worse. Clearing out their clutter does not deal with the reasons why the clutter is there. You might believe that you’re helping by turning up without advance warning or permission, or paying someone to tidy without the person knowing. However, professionals who understand hoarding should never agree to make surprise visits . They should know that it's unhelpful to tidy up against someone's wishes. This page covers: Offering general support. Helping to clean or clear. Supporting people who don't think they hoard. Tips for your own wellbeing. Living with someone who is hoarding. Offering general support. If you are supporting someone who is hoarding, whether they agree or not, you should try to keep these important points in mind: Use respectful language. Don't refer to their possessions as 'junk' or 'rubbish'. This shows that you don't understand their connection to the objects or why they want to keep them. They will be less likely to open up to you if you talk about their things this way. Don't focus on a total clean-up. While some people who hoard might be able completely clear their space, this isn't the case for everyone. The important focus should be the safety and wellbeing of your loved one, which can be achieved without completely clearing everything. This is sometimes called a 'harm reduction strategy'. You can find out more on the International OCD Foundation website. Listen to what they want. Ask the person close to you what they think will be helpful. This will give them more control over the situation and show you care about what they want. For example, they might want you to sit with them while they clean or for you to help take things to charity shops. Think carefully about gifts. It may be unhelpful to give them new items. If you want to give a gift, try thinking of alternatives like going for a meal or day out. Try to be understanding if they get rid of something you've given them. Even if this feels hurtful to you, it might be part of their progress. Don't pressure them to let you into their space. They might feel really anxious about visitors, so it's important not to take it personally if they don't invite you in. If you'd like to spend time together, it might help to consider other places you could meet instead. Let them know you are there. One of the most important things you can do is let the person you're worried about know that you care. Make sure they know that you can help them find support when they're ready. Include your loved one in calls to authorities. You might feel that authorities such as social services, the RSPCA, or the council need to be involved. If so, you should discuss this with your loved one first. This will make them feel more included in the decision and more likely to accept help. You should only call the authorities without their permission if there is a serious risk to safety. Helping to clean or clear. During their process of starting to clean or clear, you can help by thinking about the following: Respect their decisions. Most people have some attachment to things they own. You might not understand why they keep particular things. But try to remember that the items they hoard feel important to them – even if they don't seem valuable to you. Don't take over their space. It's understandable to want to help them improve things. But if you try to take charge, they might not want to accept any help at all. For example, don't touch or move things without their permission. Try to be patient. Once someone seeks help with hoarding, it can still take a long time before they're ready to make changes. Help them celebrate successes. Try celebrating after they clear a small area. They might feel very anxious about what's left to do, so it could help if you encourage them to notice achievements. You could also remind them to take things one step at a time. Discarding is never a simple yes-no process, and most items will be pondered over through several sort-throughs, over a period of months and years. Supporting people who don’t think they hoard. Not everyone is ready to admit that they have problems with hoarding. If someone close to you is in this position, try to: Be gentle – you can't force someone to change their behaviour. Don't try to persuade, trick or force someone into clearing up or throwing things away. This is unlikely to help them change in the long-term and could make them withdraw from you. Help them to seek treatment and support. For example, you could encourage them to use the Clutter Image Rating or hoarding ice breaker tools to help them talk to their doctor. For more information, see our pages on helping someone else to seek help. We also have advice on what to do if someone doesn't want help. Help them stay safe. Focus on things such as fire safety and emergency access. This can at least make the hoarding situation a safer environment. The London Fire Brigade has a fire safety checker tool, which could help if you're concerned about fire safety. Avoid making threats. Threatening to cut off contact or call authorities like the council is unlikely to help the situation. It can make your loved one feel more alone and less likely to talk to you about what they're going through. I feel that my mum is at risk in the event of a fire or if she has a medical emergency. The simple daily tasks that we all take for granted (getting into bed, cooking a meal, going up the stairs) are all made more difficult (and dangerous) by the amount of stuff in her home, and her attachment to it. Tips for your own wellbeing. Supporting someone with a mental health problem can feel draining. It's important to look after yourself as well: Set limits for yourself. It can be really difficult if you're supporting someone who doesn't think they're hoarding, or doesn't want to seek help. It's important to consider what help you feel able to offer and set yourself limits. Try peer support. Some people find it really helpful to connect with others who are also supporting someone with hoarding. To find peer support, you could contact Mind's Infoline or your local Mind to find support in your area. You can also explore our useful contacts or try online peer support, such as Side by Side. Look after yourself. Supporting someone else can sometimes be difficult and stressful. It's important to remember that your mental health is important too. For more information, see our pages on coping when supporting someone else, managing stress and maintaining your wellbeing. Living with someone who is hoarding. You might find it very difficult living with someone who is hoarding, or has hoarding disorder . You might have lived with them for a long time without mentioning their hoarding, or you might have recently realised it. What steps you take might also depend on what kind of relationship you have, and how their behaviour makes you feel. The other tips on this page can still help you, but you could also consider these ideas: Respect each other's boundaries. Work together to keep these boundaries where you need them. For example, this could involve agreeing that certain spaces need to be clutter-free for safety reasons. Or having a space in the home that's just for you. Address the hoarding problem together. Work out what common goals you have for your shared space and discuss how you can achieve these together. Give them space. It might help to give them time alone to sort things out. Some people find it easier to do this without someone else there. For example, you could go see a movie while they clean. Know your limits. It's OK if you feel you can no longer live in a space where someone is hoarding. It's not always possible to find somewhere else to stay, so it might help to try things like making sure you spend time outside the house regularly. This could include going for walks, visiting friends or going on a day out. Talking therapy. You can go to some types of talking therapies with the person who is hoarding. This can help you both express how you are feeling. The charity Relate has more information on relationship and family therapy."

Some of us may find episodes of hypomania and mania enjoyable. Or we might find them very uncomfortable, distressing or unpleasant.

Feel like you have hit a 'reset' button, and like you are a different person to before the episode.

"What causes hypomania and mania? There isn't one single or clear-cut reason that someone may become hypomanic or manic. It seems to be a combination of long-term and short-term factors, which differ from person to person. These are some possible causes of hypomania or mania: High levels of stress. Changes in sleep patterns or lack of sleep. Using recreational drugs or alcohol. Seasonal changes – for example, some people are more likely to experience hypomania and mania in spring. A significant change in your life, such as moving house or going through a divorce. Childbirth – see our page on postpartum psychosis for more information. Loss or bereavement. Trauma and abuse. Difficult life conditions – for example, problems with money, housing or loneliness. As a side effect of medication. As a symptom of a physical illness or neurological condition. Family history – if you have a family member who experiences bipolar moods, you are more likely to experience mania or hypomania. Some of these are long-term factors that might make you more likely to experience hypomania or mania in general. Whereas others are more immediate factors that might trigger an episode. A typical hypomanic episode for me will begin by a night of hardly any sleep, maybe two to three hours, then the next night I probably won't sleep at all. As a side effect of medication. Some medications can cause hypomania or mania as a side effect. This could either be while you are taking them or as a withdrawal symptom when you stop. This includes medications for physical conditions and for mental health, including some antidepressants . If you're concerned about the effects of any medication you're taking or have stopped taking, discuss this with your doctor. I had 10 years living with dysmorphia and was eventually treated with antidepressants and became flirty, flighty, promiscuous, argumentative and aggressive. When I stopped the treatment, I no longer experienced these traits. As a symptom of a physical illness or neurological condition. Some physical illnesses and neurological conditions can cause hypomania and mania. This includes lupus, encephalitis, dementia, brain injury, brain tumours and stroke. To make sure you get the correct treatment, your doctor should always check whether there might be a physical cause for your hypomania or mania before you are diagnosed."

I believed that I was always right and everyone else was always wrong. I was bubbly and my confidence was really high. At work I would complete tasks simultaneously and felt that the work was way beneath me. I also started spending a lot and would spend almost all my wage. Understand your triggers You might notice that certain types of behaviour, experience or situation can trigger a manic or hypomanic episode. For example, you might find that you often feel your mood changing after a late night. Understanding these patterns can help you take action to avoid a trigger, or minimise its impact. Learn your warning signs You may notice that there is a pattern to how you feel or behave before an episode. This could include changes in how well you sleep, your appetite, or how you spend money. Being aware that your mood is starting to change can help you make sure you have support in place. And that you can focus on looking after yourself. Triggers and warning signs can be different for everyone. It may take a little while to work out what yours are. It can also help to discuss any warning signs with people you trust, so they can help you. Make a self-management plan. When you are well, make a plan for what you can do if you start getting hypomanic or manic. You could plan how to manage your symptoms and prevent things getting worse. You might need to try a few ideas to find out what works for you. For example: Make yourself go to bed, even if you don't feel tired. Try to avoid alcohol and caffeine. Try to remember to eat regularly, even if you don't feel like it. Avoid stimulating activities. Avoid noisy, bright or busy environments and go somewhere quiet and calm. Do activities you find calming or soothing. Do relaxation or deep breathing exercises. Think about how to manage your finances. Postpone making major life decisions. Avoid situations where you may take part in risky behaviour, such as driving irresponsibly or taking recreational drugs. I have to be careful how much social contact I have - too much can send me high. I have to start saying 'no' to demands. Take practical steps. Stick to a routine Having a routine can help you feel calmer if your mood is high. And it can help with feeling more stable in general. Your routine could include: Day-to-day activities, such as when you eat meals and go to sleep. Time for relaxation or mindfulness. Time for hobbies and social plans. Taking any medication at the same time each day – this can also help you manage side effects and make sure that you have a consistent level of medication in your system.

And there are ways to look after yourself when you do feel stressed.  Manage your finances You might be concerned about how you will manage your finances when you are having a manic or hypomanic episode. You may feel this way especially if you have spent more money than you meant to during a previous episode. It may help to ask someone you trust to help you limit your spending during an episode. You might also consider making a lasting power of attorney, to formally appoint someone who can help you manage your finances if you became unwell again.  If money worries are affecting your mental health, visit our pages on money and mental health for tips which may help. You can also contact the National Debtline for free, impartial financial advice about debt. Plan ahead for a crisis When you're having a mental health crisis, it can be difficult to let others know what kind of help you need. It might help to make a crisis plan while you are well. This plan can set out what you would like to happen during a crisis, and how you would like to be treated.  I have an alarm set on my phone so I take my meds at the same time every day. Look after yourself. Try to manage your sleep Many of us with hypomania or mania may struggle with sleep during an episode. Having bad sleep could also trigger an episode. If you can improve your sleep, this can help you keep your mood stable or shorten an episode. Even if you don't feel tired, try going to bed at your usual time.  Think about physical activity Gentle exercise, like yoga or swimming, can help us relax and manage stress. And higher intensity exercise could help to burn off some energy. But some of us may find that intense exercise can trigger a hypomanic or manic episode, or make an episode worse. If you want to be more active, try to find a type of exercise that works best for you. This might involve monitoring how your mood responds to different forms of exercise.  Talk to people you trust. It can help to talk to people you trust about your mental health, how it affects you and how they can support you. These are some ideas you could try: Talk about how you feel It can help to talk about your experiences from previous episodes while you're feeling well. This could include discussing what you do and don't find helpful from others. For example, you might want to say: 'I find it frustrating that you think I'm hypomanic every time I'm happy or have a good day.' Or: 'It's really helpful when you notice I haven't been sleeping much and remind me to get a good night's sleep.' Involve people in your self-care plan It may help to involve people you trust when planning how to take care of yourself, and what to do if you're unwell. For example, you could ask if they have seen any patterns or behaviours around the times that you become unwell. This could help you understand your triggers or warning signs. Or you might already be aware of your warning signs but find it difficult to spot them. You could talk to someone about your warning signs, and ask them to let you know if they see them developing. They may notice things you don't, or be able to suggest strategies that you haven't thought of. You could talk about what kind of circumstances might mean you need more support. For example, what kind of situation might mean you need to go to hospital. The hardest thing to explain is the racing thoughts when I'm manic. It's like I've got four brains and they're all on overdrive... it can be scary but also euphoric at the same time. Try peer support. Making connections with people with similar or shared experiences can help. You could try talking to other people who have experienced hypomania or mania, to share your feelings, experiences and ideas for looking after yourself.

"Treatment for hypomania and mania. There are a range of treatments recommended for hypomania and mania. This page covers: Medication. Community-based support. Crisis services. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We also have information on how to access treatment for hypomania and mania. Talking therapies. Doctors don't usually offer talking therapy to treat an episode of hypomania or mania. But you might be offered talking therapy if you experience hypomania or mania as part of a broader mental health problem. For example, if you have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .  Medication. If you're experiencing mania or hypomania, you will normally be offered one of these antipsychotics: Haloperidol. Olanzapine. Quetiapine. Risperidone. In some cases, you may be offered a mood stabiliser as well as an antipsychotic. This is more likely if you experience mania or hypomania as part of a mood disorder, such as bipolar disorder. Or if the antipsychotic isn't working well enough on its own The mood stabilisers you might be offered include: Lithium. Valproate. Carbamazepine. You might hear some of these medications called different names.  Valproate pregnancy warning. Valproate carries the highest risk of danger to your baby out of all mood stabilisers. The regulators of this medicine say that you should not take valproate if you are pregnant. They also say you should not be prescribed valproate if you are able to become pregnant, unless you have a pregnancy prevention programme in place. See our information on anticonvulsants during pregnancy and breastfeeding to find out more. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is updating its recommendations on the use of valproate. But if you’re currently taking valproate, it’s important to continue taking it unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Find out about the planned changes . What if I'm already taking medication? Your doctor or healthcare team should review any other medication you're taking when you develop hypomania or mania. If you're taking antidepressants, your doctor may recommend that you stop taking it. This is because antidepressants can sometimes trigger hypomania or mania, or make it more severe. If you're already taking lithium and you experience hypomania or mania, your doctor or healthcare team should check your plasma lithium levels. Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.  Our pages on coming off medication give guidance on how to come off medication safely. Lithium helps me cope and I just have to keep reminding myself that whichever feeling I'm going through won't last forever. Community-based support. You might experience episodes that have a significant impact on your ability to carry out daily activities. In this case you may be referred for community-based support. This is more likely if you experience mania than hypomania. For example, you might get support from a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). These are teams of healthcare professionals, such as nurses, who offer different types of support. Or you may get support from your local authority or council, such as help with day-to-day tasks. If you experience hypomania or mania and you're struggling with day-to-day living, you may be entitled to a needs assessment . This is to help assess whether you are eligible for support.  I now have a care co-ordinator and have been stable for a few months. Crisis services. If you feel very unwell or can't keep yourself safe, you may need to access crisis services. These services include: Emergency support, such as going to Accident & Emergency (A&E) or calling 999 for an ambulance. Support from a crisis resolution and home treatment (CRHT) team. Hospital admission.  This includes information about different services, and tips for planning ahead for a possible crisis . Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Very rarely, you may be offered a treatment called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has guidelines for how doctors should use ECT . These guidelines state that you can be offered ECT if both of these are true: You are experiencing a long or severe period of mania. Other treatments have not worked, or the situation is life-threatening. If you feel like you're in this situation, your doctor may discuss this option with you. They should explain ECT in a clear and accessible way before you make any decisions. How can I access treatment for hypomania or mania? The first step to get treatment for hypomania or mania is usually to visit your GP. They should ask about your symptoms and any possible causes, such as medication. If you've been monitoring your moods, for example using a mood diary, it might help to show them this information. If your GP thinks you might be experiencing hypomania or mania, they should refer you to a specialist service. This service can then assess you more thoroughly and talk to you about your treatment options."
"Helping someone with hypomania or mania. This page is for friends and family who want to support someone they know with hypomania or mania. Start a conversation. You could try having an honest conversation with them about their hypomania or mania, and how it affects them. Ask them questions about their experiences and listen to what they have to say. By talking openly, you can learn more about what things are like for them. This can also help to build trust, so they feel more comfortable talking about their experiences and able to ask for help. Ask what you can do. If someone has experienced hypomania or mania before, they will often have an idea of what helps them and what doesn't. Ask how you can help. If they don't know, you could offer to help by exploring options together. Learn their triggers and warning signs. When they are feeling well, you could talk to them about their triggers and warning signs. This could help you support them with avoiding things that might trigger an episode. And to notice any warning signs early, so you can offer any support they might need. See our information on triggers and warning signs to find out more. Looking out for patterns, talking, remaining calm and supportive is essential. Make a plan for hypomanic or manic episodes. You could help them plan what support you can offer during a hypomanic or manic episode. This can help you both feel more prepared for what might happen. You could discuss ideas such as: Enjoying being creative together. Offering a second opinion about projects or commitments, to help them consider whether they’re taking too much on. Helping to manage money while they’re unwell, if they'd like you to. Helping them keep a routine, including regular meals and sleeping patterns. Plan for a crisis It might also help to make a crisis plan that explains what to do if they become very unwell. This could include how to spot the signs of a crisis, who to contact and what you can do to help. And you could discuss what kind of circumstances might mean they need to go to hospital. You can agree the plan in advance, and both keep a written copy. Try not to make assumptions. You might find yourself looking out for signs that they are experiencing mania or hypomania. This is completely understandable. But this might not be the most helpful way to support them. Remember that it's possible for anyone to display a range of emotions and behaviour, while still feeling stable overall. And try not to assume that any change in mood is a sign that someone is unwell. If you're not sure, talking to them is the best way to check. If those around me are concerned about whether changes are symptomatic of relapse, I encourage them to ask, not assume. Acknowledge their experiences. If they experience mania, they might see, hear or believe things that you don't. If this happens, it might feel confusing for you. They might also feel angry, annoyed or confused if you don't share their beliefs or experiences. Try to remember that what feels real for them is real in those moments. It might help if you try to: Stay as calm as you can. Let them know that, although you don't share the belief, you understand that it feels real for them. Try to focus on supporting them with how they are feeling, rather than confirming or challenging their reality. What feels real is real for him in that moment. It helps when I respect that and comfort him rather than trying to explain it's not 'real' for everyone else. Let them know if you're worried. If you're worried that they are becoming unwell, try to address this with them gently. Try to stay calm, avoid criticising or accusing them. You could explain that you've noticed changes in their behaviour and why it concerns you. And ask if they've noticed it too. If this has happened before, remind them of this and explain the pattern you see. If they say they're fine, you could suggest that you see how things go and talk about it again in a few days. Discuss challenging behaviour. If someone is very unwell, they may behave in a difficult way and may not see their behaviour as a problem. If this happens, it's OK for you to set boundaries. For example, that you will end the conversation if they're rude or aggressive with you. Or that you won't take part in any grand ideas or schemes that you are worried might end badly. Be supportive after an episode. If someone has been unwell, they may feel embarrassed or ashamed of their behaviour. Reassure them that you still care and that you understand this behaviour is part of their hypomania or mania. If they are worried that their behaviour may have long-term effects, you could offer to help them resolve this. This could be helping with a financial plan, or talking about how to improve relationships that have been affected. Help them access support. Getting the right care and support can be difficult and frustrating. You could ask if they want your help with this. For example, you could offer to research treatments , self-care ideas or local support groups. Or you could help them find a mental health advocate . Look after yourself. It can be challenging to support someone who is unwell. And it's common to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Try to remember to look after your own mental health too. You could: Set boundaries and don't take too much on. If you become unwell, you might not be able to offer as much support. It can also help to be realistic about how much support you can offer. Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone. Talk to others about how you're feeling. This doesn't mean you have to share details about the person you support. But talking about your own feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too. "

"About loneliness. Many of us feel lonely from time to time. Feelings of loneliness are personal, so everyone's experience will be different. Some people describe loneliness as the feeling we have when our need for social contact and relationships isn’t met. But loneliness isn’t the same as being alone. You may feel content without much contact with other people. But others may find this a lonely experience. Some people may only feel lonely at certain times. But some people may experience chronic loneliness. This is a deep feeling of loneliness that goes on for a long time. You may be around others and still feel like you’re alone. Some people might think that you need to live alone to feel lonely. Or that being lonely means not having many friends or family around you. But you can have lots of social contact and support and still feel lonely. Especially if you don't feel understood or cared for by the people around you. One thing I've learned is the difference between feeling alone and feeling lonely - and how you can feel lonely in a crowd full of people, but quite peaceful and content when alone. Is loneliness a mental health problem? Feeling lonely isn't a mental health problem. But having a mental health problem can increase feelings of loneliness. For example, if you’re struggling with your mental health, you may: Avoid social events and activities you usually enjoy. Have low self-esteem. Find it hard to try new things and worry about engaging with others. Find it difficult to speak to people about how you’re feeling, for fear of stigma or not being understood. Feel like you could be a burden to others. Feel overwhelmed in busy public places, or at work events and parties. I want to be able to interact with people and make new connections, but my anxiety feels like an invisible barrier that I can't break through. Feeling lonely can have a negative impact on your mental health, especially if you've felt lonely for a long time. Some research suggests that loneliness can increase stress. It's also associated with an increased risk of certain mental health problems. For example, depression , anxiety , low self-esteem and sleep problems. My anxiety and depression isolates me from people and stops me from being able to do the things I'd like to do. So socially it cuts me off. What causes loneliness? Loneliness has many different causes. These vary from person to person. We don't always understand what it is about an experience that makes us feel lonely. Certain life events or experiences may make you feel lonely, such as: Experiencing a bereavement. Going through a relationship break-up. Retirement. Changing jobs. Starting at university. Experiencing mental health problems. Becoming a parent. Moving to a new area or country without family, friends or community networks. You may feel lonely at certain times of the year. For example, around holidays like Christmas, Ramadan or Valentine's day. Research suggests that some people are more vulnerable to loneliness than others. For example, if you: Have no friends or family. Are estranged from your family. Are a single parent or care for someone else, and find it hard to maintain a social life. Belong to minority group and live in an area where there aren't many people with a similar background to you. Are excluded from social activities because of mobility problems. Don't have much money for certain social activities. Are shielding because you're at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 or other conditions. Experience discrimination and stigma because of a disability or long-term health problem. For example, mental health problems. Experience discrimination and stigma because of your gender, race or your gender or sexual identity. Have experienced sexual or physical abuse, which may mean you find it harder to form close relationships with other people. When I suffered from anorexia it fed into so many areas of life. It was all-consuming. One of those areas was loneliness. It was something that I felt for such a long time. Loneliness and money. Many of us are struggling with money right now. This may have an impact on how often we can see other people. This can affect our wellbeing and how lonely we feel. If you can’t afford the things you need, help is out there. Visit our pages on money and mental health to find out more about what support might be available to you. Print this page"
"How can I manage loneliness? This page has some tips and suggestions for managing feelings of loneliness: Learn more about being comfortable in your own company. Try and open up to people you know. Take it slow. Make new connections. Try not to compare yourself to others. Look after yourself. Try talking therapies. Some people find these ideas useful. But remember that different things work for different people at different times. Only try what you feel comfortable with, and try not to put too much pressure on yourself. If something isn't working for you (or doesn't feel possible just now), you can try something else or come back to it another time. Learn more about being comfortable in your own company. Having lots of friends and contacts in your life doesn’t mean you won’t feel lonely. For many of us, feeling lonely is linked to low self-esteem or self-confidence. Sometimes, improving our relationships with ourselves, as well as others, can help us feel less lonely. You may find it helpful to look at our information about self-esteem . You could start by thinking about what self-care means to you. Remember that self-care looks different for everyone. Some people who live alone find it comforting to have some background noise. This could be the television, the radio or a podcast you enjoy. It may help to start doing activities you enjoy by yourself. For example, going for a walk in your local area, doing some arts and crafts or cooking a meal from scratch. It could also involve moving your body, watching a film you love, decluttering your home or going to a free museum in your area. It’s okay to try different things to see what makes you feel good. Try and be patient with yourself. Social care If you have needs for care and support, there may be ways in which the law can help you. The Care Act 2014 in England and the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 in Wales place general obligations on local authorities to promote wellbeing and to prevent social care needs from arising. They also contain specific duties for local authorities to help individuals.  You can also contact Mind's Legal Line with your specific enquiry. Try and open up to people you know. You might feel like you know plenty of people, but don’t have a deep connection with them. Or that the people around you don't give you the care and attention that you need. If this is how you feel, it might help to open up to someone you trust. This could be a friend or family member, a colleague or someone else in your life. You don’t need to speak face-to-face. You could send them a text message, or send a message to someone on social media. Many of us have experienced loneliness, but it can be a scary thought to tell other people about it. It might be helpful to think about what you want to say in advance. You may find that they’ve experienced similar feelings before. Being able to normalise feeling lonely with someone you trust may help you feel a bit better. Take it slow. If you've felt lonely for a long time, it might feel overwhelming to start opening up to people. Trying to meet new people may also worry you. But you don't need to rush into anything. To start small, try and make conversations with people you come across in your day-to-day life. For example, this could be saying hello to a cashier in your local shop. Or making conversation with a neighbour. Some people find it useful to be in environments where there are lots of people around. For example, coffee shops, libraries or shopping centres. Feeling the presence of other people may help with some feelings of loneliness. It may help to establish a routine, where you go to the same places at the same time. You might start to recognise people in these places, which may lead to forming connections. Try thinking about how your interests could help you connect with other people. For example, if you like reading, you could join an online forum for conversations about books. You could also spend some time in a local library before joining a book club. Focus on environments where you feel safe and try not to put too much pressure on yourself. You could try an online activity where other people attend but you're not expected to interact with them. For example, a drawing class or another kind of creative workshop. You could ask whoever runs the sessions if you can just watch at first, rather than taking part. Make new connections. We have listed some different types of peer support and ways to make new connections. These may provide a space to meet new people and find support: Join an online community like Side by Side. These communities can provide a place to listen and share with others who have similar experiences. They're available 24/7. Most are free, and you can access them wherever you are. Meetup is a website where you can meet new people who share your interests, through online and in-person events. If you don’t see any groups or activities that interest you, you could try and start your own group. If you’re able to, volunteering is a good way to meet people. You can do it in-person or at home. Helping others can also really improve your mental health. It’s a good idea to check that you’ll receive adequate support from the organisation you are volunteering at.  Join a group on social media to talk to others in your area. For example, many areas of the UK have local Facebook groups that you can join to meet others who live nearby. Ask your GP to refer you to a social prescribing link worker. They can refer you to local sources of support. For example, voluntary and community sector organisations. Contact Mind's Infoline or a local Mind to see what other types of peer support there may be in your area. Try a befriender service. Various charities offer telephone befriender services. They put volunteer befrienders in touch with people who are feeling lonely.  I never feel lonely when I'm in nature. I feel more connected than ever when I'm walking alone through a wood or by a river. Try not to compare yourself to others. Many of us have changed the way we communicate over the last few years. We’re connecting with others online and through social media more. Being able to interact with more people online has been a positive experience for many of us. But others may find this challenging. We often only see what other people want to share about their lives on social media. Seeing photos of others at events, or socialising with friends and family, might make us feel like we’re the only one who’s feeling lonely. Being able to access so many people’s lives can sometimes feel overwhelming. It’s sometimes hard to stop comparing ourselves to others. But remember that things aren’t always what they seem from the outside. We don’t know how other people feel when they’re alone. Or what’s going on for them outside of their social media feed. If you're worried that social media might be affecting your mental health, see our information on online mental health . I sometimes feel lonely when I am overwhelmed by human information – the news, social media, TV, negative gossip etc. – I feel so separate and different to most people. Look after yourself. Feeling lonely can affect your wellbeing. Making small changes in your day-to-day life may help you feel more able to connect with others. For example: Physical activity can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing. Some people also find it helps to improve their self-esteem. If you want to meet people while exercising, you could join a local exercise class or an online class. There’s also parkrun, which has free, weekly 5 k runs or walks local to you.  Spend time in nature if you can. This can improve your sense of wellbeing and reduce feelings of loneliness. For example, you could plant some vegetables in your garden or on your windowsill. Organisations such as Ramblers arrange local walks for people to walk together. You can also look at our pages on nature and mental health for more ideas. Some people find that spending time around animals can help with feelings of loneliness. You could try visiting a local community or city farm. The organisation Social Farms and Gardens has a list of outdoor community projects across the UK. Many of these have animals that the public can interact with. There are also websites that connect animal owners with people who want to look after them, such as Borrow my Doggy. You might feel lonelier during certain times of year. For example, at Christmas or on certain anniversaries. It might be helpful to think in advance about what activities you could do to make you feel good at these times. Try talking therapies. Talking therapies can help you explore what feeling lonely means to you. Your therapist can help you develop different ways of managing your feelings. If anxiety about social situations has made you feel isolated, you may find cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) helpful. This type of therapy focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behaviour. Your therapist can help you develop coping strategies for different situations that you find difficult.  Print this page"

"What are mental health problems? In many ways, mental health is just like physical health: everybody has it and we need to take care of it. Good mental health means being generally able to think, feel and react in the ways that you need and want to live your life. But if you go through a period of poor mental health you might find the ways you're frequently thinking, feeling or reacting become difficult, or even impossible, to cope with. This can feel just as bad as a physical illness, or even worse. Mental health problems affect around one in four people in any given year. They range from common problems, such as depression and anxiety , to rarer problems such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . I now know that if I felt there was something wrong, it's because there was, but I didn't understand mental health fully... it's a spectrum and you should feel able to decide where and when you [are] on that spectrum. Am I the only one who feels this way? Experiencing a mental health problem is often upsetting, confusing and frightening – particularly at first. If you become unwell, you may feel that it's a sign of weakness, or that you are 'losing your mind'. These fears are often reinforced by the negative (and often unrealistic) way that people experiencing mental health problems are shown on TV, in films and by the media. This may stop you from talking about your problems, or seeking help . This, in turn, is likely to increase your distress and sense of isolation. However, in reality, mental health problems are a common human experience . Most people know someone who has experienced a mental health problem. They can happen to all kinds of people from all walks of life. And it's likely that, when you find a combination of self-care , treatment and support that works for you, you will get better . It wasn't until I had a breakdown that I felt my condition was 'serious enough' to qualify as an issue. I could have got help much earlier but I didn't because of this – it's never too early to seek advice. Different perspectives on mental health and mental illness There are various approaches to mental health and mental illness around the world. Most health professionals in the UK agree on a similar set of clinical diagnoses and treatments for mental health problems. We have chosen to reflect this approach in our information, as these are the terms and treatment models that you are most likely to come across if you seek help in England or Wales. However, not everyone finds it helpful to think about their mental health this way. Depending on your traditions and beliefs you might have different ideas about how best to cope. In many cultures, emotional wellbeing is closely associated with religious or spiritual life. And your difficult experiences may be just one part of how you understand your identity overall. We use the phrase 'mental health problems', as many people have told us this feels helpful for them. But you might be more familiar with terms such as 'poor emotional health', 'overloaded', 'burnt out' or 'overwhelmed'. Or you may feel that terms such as 'mental illness' or 'mental health issues' describe your experiences better, or are easier to explain to other people in your life. However you understand your own experiences, and whatever terms you prefer to use, we hope that you will find the information in these pages useful when considering different options for care and support."
"What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less worthwhile. At its most severe, depression can make you feel suicidal , and be life-threatening. Some types occur during or after pregnancy (antenatal and postnatal depression), or may come back each year around the same time (seasonal affective disorder). To find out more see our pages on: depression. postnatal depression (PND). seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Bringing back joy to fight depression. On bad days, I exist in a world that seems devoid of any colour... Read Eleanor's story Anxiety problems. Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. Occasional anxiety is a normal human experience. But if your feelings of anxiety are very strong, or last for a long time, they can be overwhelming. You might also experience physical symptoms such as sleep problems and panic attacks . You might be diagnosed with a particular anxiety disorder, such as generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety (social phobia), panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). But it's also possible to experience problems with anxiety without having a specific diagnosis. To find out more see our pages on: anxiety and panic attacks. post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Phobias. A phobia is an extreme form of fear or anxiety triggered by a particular situation (such as going outside) or object (such as spiders), even when it's very unlikely to be dangerous. A fear becomes a phobia if the fear is out of proportion to the danger, it lasts for more than six months, and has a significant impact on how you live your day-to-day life. To find out more, see our pages on phobias . Living with my phobia of bananas. It isn't exactly a common phobia – but for me, it is a daily challenge. Read Vix's story Going out of the house is a challenge because I [have a] fear of panicking and feel that I'm being watched or judged. Eating problems. Eating problems are not just about food. They can be about difficult things and painful feelings which you may be finding hard to face or resolve. Lots of people think that if you have an eating problem you will be over- or underweight, and that being a certain weight is always associated with a specific eating problem, but this is a myth. Anyone, regardless of age, gender or weight, can be affected by eating problems. The most common eating disorder diagnoses are anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). But it's also possible to have a very difficult relationship with food and not fit the criteria for any specific diagnosis. To find out more, see our pages on eating problems . Talking about eating problems. It took over everything, became my identity. Read Dave's story Schizophrenia. Views on schizophrenia have changed over the years. Lots of people question whether it's really a distinct condition, or actually a few different conditions that overlap. But you may still be given this diagnosis if you experience symptoms such as: psychosis (such as hallucinations or delusions). disorganised thinking and speech. feeling disconnected from your feelings. difficulty concentrating. wanting to avoid people. a lack of interest in things. not wanting to look after yourself. Because psychiatric experts disagree about what schizophrenia is, some people argue that this term shouldn't be used at all. Others think the name of the condition doesn't matter, and prefer to just focus on helping you manage your symptoms and meeting your individual needs. To find out more see our pages on: schizophrenia. schizoaffective disorder. psychosis. paranoia. hearing voices. People call me crazy - my film about schizophrenia. ...[A] goal of mine was to honestly explain schizophrenia to people and to dismiss the myths around it. Read Juno's story Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. The term is often misused in daily conversation – for example, you might hear people talk about being 'a bit OCD', if they like things to be neat and tidy. But the reality of this disorder is a lot more complex and serious. OCD has two main parts: obsessions (unwelcome thoughts, images, urges, worries or doubts that repeatedly appear in your mind; and compulsions (repetitive activities that you feel you have to do to reduce the anxiety caused by the obsession). To find out more see our pages on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) . Personality disorders. Personality disorder is a type of mental health problem where your attitudes, beliefs and behaviours cause you longstanding problems in your life. If you have this diagnosis it doesn't mean that you're fundamentally different from other people – but you may regularly experience difficulties with how you think about yourself and others, and find it very difficult to change these unwanted patterns. There are several different categories and types of personality disorder, but most people who are diagnosed with a particular personality disorder don't fit any single category very clearly or consistently. Also, the term 'personality disorder' can sound very judgemental. Because of this it is a particularly controversial diagnosis. Some psychiatrists disagree with using it. And many people who are given this label find it more helpful to explain their experiences in other ways. To find out more see our pages on: personality disorders. borderline personality disorder (BPD). Having a BPD diagnosis - my reality. Public awareness of BPD remains very low. Read Rebecca's story Bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder (once called manic depression) mainly affects your mood. With this diagnosis you are likely to have times when you experience: manic or hypomanic episodes (feeling high); depressive episodes (feeling low); and potentially some psychotic symptoms. Everyone has variations in their mood, but in bipolar disorder these swings can feel very extreme and have a big impact on your life. In between, you might have stable times where you experience fewer symptoms. To find out more see our pages on bipolar disorder . Being diagnosed with bipolar. I am still the same person inside and with the help of medication I can now manage the extremes. Read Lee's story"
"What else might I experience? This page provides a brief overview of some difficult feelings and behaviours which are often associated with mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Panic attacks. Panic attacks are a type of fear response. They're an exaggeration of your body's normal response to danger, stress or excitement. During a panic attack physical symptoms can build up very quickly, including: a pounding heartbeat or chest pains. sweating and nausea (feeling sick). feeling faint and unable to breathe. shaky limbs, or feeling like your legs are turning to jelly. feeling as if you aren't connected to your body. It's easy to mistake these for the signs of a heart attack or another serious medical problem. You might feel very afraid that you're losing control, that you're going to faint or even going to die. To find out more see our page on panic attacks . Self-harm. Self-harm is when you hurt yourself as a way of dealing with very difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. You may not know why you self-harm, but it can be a means of expressing feelings that you can't put into words or think clearly about. After self-harming you may feel a short-term sense of release, but the cause of your distress is unlikely to have gone away. Self-harm can also bring up very difficult emotions and could make you feel worse. To find out more see our pages on self-harm . My body comes with a trigger warning. I didn't know how else to cope. I didn't like myself. Read Seaneen's story Suicidal feelings. Many people experience suicidal thoughts and feelings at some point in their lifetime. They can be very unpleasant, intrusive and frightening, but having thoughts about suicide doesn't necessarily mean that you intend to act on them. Most people don't go on to attempt to take their own lives. However, if you feel you may act on suicidal feelings and become unable to keep yourself safe then this a mental health emergency. It's important to treat it as seriously as you would any physical health emergency, and seek urgent help – for example by dialling 999, going to your nearest A&E, or calling the Samaritans on 116 123. To find out more see our pages on: coping with suicidal feelings. supporting someone who feels suicidal. It's okay to ask for help. A staggering 78% of suicides in the UK are by men. Yet not enough people are talking about it. Read Steven's story Psychosis. Psychosis (also called a psychotic experience or psychotic episode) is when you perceive or interpret reality in a very different way from people around you. The most common types of psychosis are: hallucinations, such as hearing voices or having visions. delusions, such as paranoia or delusions of grandeur. Psychosis affects people in different ways. You might experience it once, have short episodes throughout your life, or live with it most of the time. It's also possible to have a psychotic experience without ever being diagnosed with a particular mental health problem. Some people have a positive experience of psychosis. You may find it comforting, or feel that it helps you understand the world or makes you more creative. To find out more see our pages on: psychosis. paranoia. hearing voices. [Psychosis] felt as though I was in wonderland. None of my family or friends understood why... I had a calling from a voice in sky. I was lost and lonely."
"What causes mental health problems? Mental health problems can have a wide range of causes. It's likely that for many people there is a complicated combination of factors – although different people may be more deeply affected by certain things than others. For example, the following factors could potentially result in a period of poor mental health: childhood abuse, trauma, or neglect. social isolation or loneliness. experiencing discrimination and stigma, including racism. social disadvantage, poverty or debt. bereavement (losing someone close to you). severe or long-term stress. having a long-term physical health condition. unemployment or losing your job. homelessness or poor housing. being a long-term carer for someone. drug and alcohol misuse. domestic violence, bullying or other abuse as an adult. significant trauma as an adult, such as military combat, being involved in a serious incident in which you feared for your life, or being the victim of a violent crime. physical causes – for example, a head injury or a neurological condition such as epilepsy can have an impact on your behaviour and mood. (It's important to rule out potential physical causes before seeking further treatment for a mental health problem). Although lifestyle factors including work, diet, drugs and lack of sleep can all affect your mental health, if you experience a mental health problem there are usually other factors as well. My depression seems to flare up during times when I am stressed and isolated from other people. Do mental health problems run in families? Research suggests that some mental health problems may run in families . For example, if you have a parent with schizophrenia , you are more likely to develop schizophrenia yourself. But no one knows if this is because of our genes or because of other factors , such as the environment we grow up in, or the ways of thinking, coping and behaving that we may learn from our parents. Although the development of some mental health problems may be influenced by our genes, researchers haven't found any specific genes that definitely cause mental health problems. And many people who experience a mental health problem don't have any parents, children or other relatives with the same condition. Is brain chemistry a factor? The human brain is extremely complicated. Some research suggests that mental health problems may be linked to a variation in certain brain chemicals (such as serotonin and dopamine). But no one really understands how or why. Arguments that someone's brain chemistry is the cause of mental health problems are very weak. But even though there's no strong evidence to say that any mental health problems are caused by a chemical imbalance in our brains , you might find some people still use brain chemistry to explain them. Reasons for this might include: Some psychiatric medications work by acting on chemicals in the brain, and there's lots of evidence to show that medication can be effective in treating some symptoms of mental health problems (although drugs don't work the same way for everyone). Mental health problems can feel very personal and be hard to understand, so the idea that there could be a distinct physical cause for difficult thoughts, feelings and behaviours might make it feel easier to talk openly about your experiences and ask for help. Just because we may not know exactly what causes someone to experience a mental health problem, this doesn't mean that it is any less serious than any other illness , any less deserving of recognition and treatment, or any easier to recover from."
"How are they diagnosed? To diagnose a mental health problem, doctors will look at: your experiences (groupings of certain feelings, behaviours and physical symptoms may suggest different diagnoses). how long you've been experiencing these things. the impact it's having on your life. To do this they may ask you questions about your mood, thoughts and behaviours – sometimes by using questionnaires or forms. They will base your diagnosis on what you describe. For example, if you tell your doctor you've been experiencing low mood, low energy and a lack of interest in usual activities for more than two weeks, they may give you a diagnosis of depression . If your symptoms change you might find you are given different diagnoses over time. Having a diagnosis does not necessarily mean that you are unwell right now. You could have a diagnosis of a mental health problem but, at the moment, be able to manage it and function well at work and at home. Equally, you might not have a particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. Getting the PTSD diagnosis gave me something to work with and find the words to describe what was happening. Who can diagnose me? For common problems such as depression and anxiety , your GP may be able to give you a diagnosis after one or two appointments. For less common problems you'll need to be referred to a mental health specialist (such as a psychiatrist), and they may want to see you over a longer period of time before making a diagnosis. For information on how to seek help and what you might say to your doctor, see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem . After overcoming the initial shock of the diagnosis, it is actually a blessing because now I know what I need to do to get better. What if I don't find my diagnosis helpful? Receiving a diagnosis can be a positive experience. You might feel relieved that you can put a name to what's wrong, and it can help you and your doctor discuss what kind of treatment might work best for you. However, a lot of people, including some doctors and psychiatrists, feel this medical model of diagnosis and treatment is not enough. For example, you might feel that the diagnosis you're given doesn't fully fit your experiences, or that it's simplistic and puts you in a box. Other factors – such as your background, lifestyle and other personal circumstances – may be just as important in understanding what you're experiencing and working out how best to help you feel better. A diagnosis does not have to shape your entire life, and may come to be a relatively minor part of your identity. Initially I took this diagnosis of BPD as an insult, a criticism of my whole being, but then I began to understand that it is just a diagnosis, an explanation of why I feel as I do."
"How can I deal with stigma? Unfortunately, not everyone understands mental health problems. Some people may have misconceptions about what certain diagnoses mean. They may also use language you find dismissive, offensive or hurtful. This can be very upsetting – especially if someone who feels this way is a family member, colleague or a healthcare professional. But it's important to remember that you aren't alone, and you don't have to put up with people treating you badly. Here are some options for you to think about: Show people reliable information to help them understand more about what your diagnosis really means. You can find reliable information in our pages on types of mental health problems. Get more involved in your treatment.  Contact an advocate. An advocate is someone who can support your choices and help you make your voice heard (see our pages on advocacy for more information). Know your rights. Our pages on your legal rights provide information on your rights in a wide range of situations. Talk about your experience. Sharing your story can help improve people's understanding and change their attitudes (see our blogs pages to read about other people's experiences, and find out how to blog for Mind). Get involved in a campaign. Our campaigns page has details of the different ways you can get involved with Mind. If you are in Wales, you could also join the Time to Change Wales campaign to help end mental health stigma and discrimination. I don't choose or want to be psychotic any more than people choose or want any other types of ill health. Are people with mental health problems dangerous? Some people think there is an automatic link between mental health problems and being a danger to others. This is an idea that is reinforced by sensationalised stories in the media. However, the most common mental health problems have no significant link to violent behaviour . The proportion of people living with a mental health problem who commit a violent crime is extremely small. There are lots of reasons someone might commit a violent crime, and factors such as drug and alcohol misuse are far more likely to be the cause of violent behaviour. But many people are still worried about talking about how they're feeling, or seeking help, because of the fear and stigma of being seen as dangerous. It's important to remember that experiencing difficult thoughts, feelings and behaviours when you're unwell is common, and it's extremely unlikely to mean you may harm another person. The stigma of being violent and dangerous is the worst for me. I am a caring and empathetic soul who would do anything for the people I love."
"How can I help myself? Self-care techniques and general lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms of many mental health problems. They may also help prevent some problems from developing or getting worse. Here are some tips for looking after yourself that you might find helpful. If these work well for you then you may find you don't need any formal treatment . However, it's important to remember that there is unlikely to be an instant solution. Recovering from a mental health problem is likely to take time, energy and work. Our pages on improving and maintaining your mental wellbeing have more self-care suggestions and tips. Stay aware of your mental health add remove Tell people what helps. If certain treatments have helped in the past, tell your doctor. Let your friends and family know how they can support you, whether it's listening to you when you're having a bad day, helping you keep on top of your commitments, or being aware of your triggers (things that set off your difficult feelings or behaviours, or make them worse). Spot your early warning signs. If you can, try to be aware of how you're feeling, and watch out for any signs you might be becoming unwell. These will be individual to you, but it can be useful to reflect on what these may be so you can get support as soon as possible. Keep a mood diary. Tracking your moods can help you to work out what makes you feel better or worse. You can then take steps to avoid, change or prepare for difficult situations. You can create your own mood diary or find one online – there are many freely available on the internet and as apps for your phone. Build your self-esteem. Taking steps to increase your self-esteem can help you to feel more confident and able to cope (see our pages on how to increase your self-esteem for more information). Read Beth's blog about how to cope when low self-esteem sneaks up on you . I really have to remember to be kind to myself and actually try to function when I'm unwell. Otherwise things spiral even faster. Nourish your social life add remove Feeling connected to other people is important. It can help you to feel valued and confident about yourself, and can give you a different perspective on things. If you can, try to spend some time connecting with friends and family – even a text or phone call can make a difference. If you don't have supportive friends and family around you and are feeling isolated, there are other ways you can make connections. For example, you could try going to community events where you might have some interests or experiences in common with other people there, or joining a group like a local book club or sports team. Read Joanna's blog about overcoming loneliness . I try to have a friendly conversation everyday, even if it is online with distant friends. Try peer support add remove When you experience a mental health problem it can feel like no one understands. Peer support brings together people who've had similar experiences to support each other. This can offer many benefits, such as: feeling accepted for who you are. increased self-confidence. meeting new people and using your experiences to help others. finding out new information and places for support. challenging stigma and discrimination. You can contact Mind's Infoline for details of local support groups near you, or try online peer support like Mind's community Side by Side (see our pages on peer support for more information). Read Craig's experience of how online support groups helped him when no one else was there . Things I was ashamed of and felt guilt for were common in the group. It was a profound and powerful experience. Make time for therapeutic activities add remove There are various techniques and therapies you can safely practise on your own. For example: Relaxation – you may already know what helps you relax, like having a bath, listening to music or taking your dog for a walk. If you know that a certain activity helps you feel more relaxed, make sure you set aside time to do it. (). Mindfulness – mindfulness is a therapeutic technique that involves being more aware of the present moment. This can mean both outside, in the world around you, and inside, in your feelings and thoughts. Practising mindfulness can help you become more aware of your own moods and reactions, but not everyone finds mindfulness helpful. (). Getting into nature – getting out into a green environment, such as a park or the countryside, is especially good for you. Even if you don't have a garden or aren't very mobile, caring for plants or animals indoors can still help you get some benefits from nature. (). These activities can be particularly valuable if you don't want to try medication or talking treatments, or you're having to wait a while for treatment on the NHS. I do ecotherapy to get sunlight onto my skin and into my mind. It shines light through the dark fog of depression. Look after your physical health add remove Taking steps to look after your physical health can help you manage your mental health too. Get enough sleep Rest when you can. This can help you have the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences. See our info on coping with sleep problems. Keep physically active Regular exercise doesn't have to be very strenuous or sporty to be effective – to start with you could try gentle exercise like going for a short walk, yoga or swimming. The important thing is to pick something you enjoy doing, so you're more likely to stick with it. If you're physically disabled, Disability Rights UK provides information about exercises you might be able to do. Alternatively, ask your doctor for advice. See our info on physical activity and exercise. Avoid drugs and alcohol While you might want to use drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, in the long run they can make you feel a lot worse. You can contact Turning Point for information and support to stop using drugs and alcohol. Make time for personal care When you're experiencing a mental health problem, it's easy for personal care to not feel like a priority. But small everyday things, such as taking a shower and getting fully dressed, can make a big difference to how you feel. Eat healthily What you eat, and when you eat, can make a big difference to how well you feel. See our info on food and mood. Read Shalini's blog about how dancing helped her cope . I'm not the sporty type, but I love walking. It really lifts my mood. Contact a specialist organisation add remove If you have a diagnosis, or would like support in a specific area, try contacting a specialist organisation for help. For example: Anxiety UK offers advice and support for people living with anxiety. Beat provides information and support for people affected by eating disorders. Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) supports anyone affected by suicide or suicidal thoughts. FRANK provides confidential drugs advice and information. Hearing Voices Network runs an online forum and local groups across the country. Mind Out offers mental health advice and support for anyone who identifies as LGBTQ+. No Panic offers help and advice about anxiety disorders, including a helpline and recovery groups. Student Minds supports students with their mental health. Young Minds supports children and young people with their mental health."
"What treatments are available? This page gives an overview of the two most common forms of treatment offered though the NHS: talking treatments and psychiatric medication . It also explains some available alternatives, such as arts and creative therapies and complementary and alternative therapies , and explains where you can find out more. The NICE guidelines. Any treatment your doctor offers you will ideally follow what the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends for your condition. NICE is the organisation that produces official clinical guidelines on best practice in healthcare. These guidelines are based on published evidence, expert contributions and real life experiences. They are officially for use in England, but may be used in Wales and other parts of the UK too. However, although healthcare professionals are all encouraged to follow the NICE guidelines, unfortunately access to recommended treatments still varies enormously across the NHS. For information on accessing treatment, see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem . I didn't realise I was experiencing issues for a long time, and then put off seeing someone about it – just knowing you are actually finally getting help is such a relief. Talking treatments. Talking treatments provide a regular time and space for you to talk about your thoughts and experiences and explore difficult feelings with a trained professional. This could help you to: deal with a specific problem. cope with upsetting memories or experiences. improve your relationships. develop more helpful ways of living day-to-day. You may hear various terms used to describe talking treatments, including counselling, psychotherapy, therapy, talking therapy or psychological therapy. These terms are all used to describe the same general style of treatment. There are lots of different kinds of therapy available in the UK and it's important to find a style and a therapist that you feel comfortable with. () Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) If you're referred for therapy through the NHS, you're likely to be offered a type of talking treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a relatively short-term treatment which aims to identify connections between your thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and to help you develop practical skills to manage any negative patterns that may be causing you difficulties. Evidence suggests that CBT can be an effective treatment for a range of mental health problems. However, although many people can benefit from CBT, not everyone finds it helpful. You might find that it just doesn't suit you, or doesn't meet your needs. () Talking things through with a counsellor or therapist really helps me to see things more rationally and make connections between reality and inside my head. Medication. The most common type of treatment available is psychiatric medication. These drugs don't cure mental health problems, but they can ease many symptoms. Which type of drug you are offered will depend on your diagnosis. For example: Antidepressants These are mostly prescribed for people experiencing depression , though you might also be offered an antidepressant if you're experiencing anxiety , obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) , eating problems , or depression as part of another mental health problem. See our info on antidepressants. See our A–Z of antidepressants. Antipsychotics These may be prescribed to reduce distressing symptoms of psychosis , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder and sometimes severe anxiety . They are sometimes also prescribed for people experiencing bipolar disorder as they can help control hypomania and mania . See our info on antipsychotics. See our A–Z of antipsychotics. Sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers These can help you sleep if you experience severe sleep problems , or calm you down if you experience severe anxiety (sometimes called anti-anxiety medication). See our info on sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers. See our A–Z of sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers. Mood stabilisers (including lithium) These can help stabilise your mood if you experience extreme mood swings, for example if you have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder . They may also be prescribed for hypomania and mania and sometimes recurrent severe depression . See our info on mood stabilisers. Many people find these drugs helpful, as they can lessen your symptoms and allow you to cope at work and at home. However, drugs can sometimes have unpleasant side effects that may make you feel worse rather than better. They can also be difficult to withdraw from, or cause you physical harm if taken in too high a dose. Before you take any medication Make sure you have all the information you need to feel confident about your decision. For guidance on what you might want to ask your doctor about any drug before you take it, including your right to refuse medication: See our info on psychiatric medication. How treatment helped me to live with depression and anxiety. Mental illness is a part of who you are, but it doesn't define you. You are not your illness. Read Rachel's story Antidepressants helped once I found the right ones. Arts and creative therapies. Arts and creative therapies are a way of using the arts (music, painting, dance or drama) to express and understand yourself in a therapeutic environment, with a trained therapist. This can be especially helpful if you find it difficult to talk about your problems and how you are feeling. () Complementary and alternative therapies. Some people find complementary and alternative therapies helpful to manage stress and other common symptoms of mental health problems. These can include things like yoga, meditation, aromatherapy, hypnotherapy, herbal remedies and acupuncture. The clinical evidence for these options is not as robust as it is for other treatments, but you may find they work for you. ()"
"What support is available? If your mental health problems are severe or longer lasting, or the treatment your doctor has offered you isn't working, they can refer you to specialist mental health services. This page provides a brief overview of the following services, and explains where you can find more information: community mental health teams (CMHTs). social (or community) care. residential care. crisis intervention. hospital treatment. Mental health services for under-18 s. The NHS services that support young people's mental health are called Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) . You may also hear them called CYPMHS (Children and Young People’s Mental Health Services). Learn about CAMHS Learn about moving from child to adult mental health services Community mental health teams (CMHTs). CMHTs support people with mental health problems living in the community, and also their carers. The team may include a community psychiatric nurse (CPN), a psychologist, an occupational therapist, a counsellor and a community support worker, as well as a social worker. Often, a member of the team will be appointed as your care coordinator, to keep in regular contact with you and help plan your care. Social (or community) care. Social care is any care or support you need to carry out day-to-day tasks which you're finding difficult. This could include help with managing money or improving relationships, transport to attend appointments or services, or assistance with benefits and housing applications. You can ask your doctor or CMHT to refer you to social services, or you can contact them directly to ask for an assessment. (See our legal pages about health and social care for more information on your rights to social care, and how to access these services.) In praise of day centres. The staff are wonderful - expert, warm, funny... And completely accessible. Read Marian's story Residential care. If you aren't able to cope on your own at home, there are other options for housing. You can talk through your options with your support worker(s), carers and mental health team. You might be able to access: hostels – these are short-term accommodation, with supervision, to help you until you can live more independently. residential care homes – these offer a much higher level of support for people with severe mental health problems. therapeutic communities – these are for short stays, with group or individual therapy as part of their rehabilitation programmes. supported housing schemes – these enable you to live independently, in furnished accommodation, with the back-up of a mental health support worker in case you need extra help. () Crisis intervention. In most areas, you should have access to a crisis resolution and home treatment team (CRHT). These teams can support you through a crisis at home. They may give you a local crisis number, which you can call instead of 999 in a mental health emergency. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. I did take myself to the crisis team at A&E and got some help, [although I was] left to sit on my own for two hours. [After waiting] I was put in touch with the right people – they came to see me while I was there and I had a psych evaluation. Campaigning for excellent crisis care While we know that excellent crisis services do exist, unfortunately they're not consistently available across the UK. We know how frustrating and difficult it can be to cope with services that don't provide the precise help you need, exactly when you need it. That's why we're campaigning to improve crisis care across the country. See our campaigns page to find out more. Hospital treatment. Hospital inpatient services support people with severe mental health problems, or people who are experiencing a crisis. Most hospital admissions are voluntary, but if you are assessed and judged to be at risk of harming yourself or others, you can be detained under a section of the Mental Health Act 1983 (in England and Wales). This is often called being sectioned. How long you stay in hospital will depend on your personal situation. Being treated in hospital can mean you have faster access to treatment, round-the-clock support and are kept safe during a crisis. Some people find hospital a positive experience, while others find it unpleasant as you might be far away from your support network, in an unfamiliar place or admitted against your will. If you are treated in hospital, it's important to know your rights. Our legal pages on sectioning , voluntary patients and leaving hospital have more information. My experience of crisis care, depression and speaking out. It was as though the colour had been sucked out of my world. Read Karl's story It began changing for me when one hospital suggested that there was a way forward... they were able to offer me far more time than individuals had."
"Will I recover? It is possible to recover from mental health problems , and many people do – especially after accessing support. Your symptoms may return from time to time, but when you've discovered which self-care techniques and treatments work best for you, you're more likely to feel confident in managing them. If you're experiencing a more serious mental health problem, it's still possible to find ways to manage your symptoms. For many people, recovery doesn't necessarily mean going back to how your life was before, but learning new ways to live your life the way you want to, and gaining control over areas of your life that might have felt out of control before. However, it's important to remember that recovery is a journey and it won't always be straightforward. You might find it more helpful to focus on learning more about yourself and developing ways to cope, rather than trying to get rid of every symptom of your mental health problem. What recovery means to you will be personal, but for most people, the most important thing is to find ways to live the kind of life you want. How volunteering helped my recovery. It's helped me to remember that I needn't be afraid of people... Read Alex-Marie's story With time you do learn to cope... I have struggled for 15 years with [my mental health problem], but every year I seem to get stronger and better at coping with it!"
"How can other people be supportive? This page is for friends and family who would like to support someone who is experiencing a mental health problem. It can be very difficult to see someone who you care about becoming unwell, but you don't need to be an expert on mental health to offer support. Often small, everyday actions can make the biggest difference. Show your support. If you know someone has been unwell, don't be afraid to ask how they are. They might want to talk about it, or they might not. But just letting them know they don't have to avoid the issue with you is important. Spending time with your loved one lets them know you care, and can help you understand what they're going through. Supporting my daughter through crisis. Despite mental health problems, with the right support, people can overcome a crisis. Read Lynn's story Sometimes all you need is a hug and for someone to tell you that you're going to get there. Ask how you can help. Everyone will want support at different times and in different ways, so ask how you can help. It might be useful to help keep track of medication, or give support at a doctor's appointment. If your friend wants to get more exercise, you could do this together, or if your partner is affected by lack of sleep, you could help them get into a regular sleeping pattern. Be open-minded. Phrases like 'cheer up', 'I'm sure it'll pass' and 'pull yourself together' definitely don't help. Try to be non-judgemental and listen. Someone experiencing a mental health problem often knows best what's helpful for them. Leave out the 'cheer up' comments, they don't help and force my low moods lower as my condition is being made a joke of. Don't just talk about mental health. Keep in mind that having a mental health problem is just one aspect of your friend or family member's life. Most people don't want to be defined by their mental health problem, so keep talking about the things you've always talked about together. For me, it is good to have them there to talk to me about other things, and take my mind off negative thoughts. Show trust and respect. Trust and respect between you and your friend or family member are very important – they help to rebuild and maintain a sense of self-esteem, which a mental health problem can seriously damage. This can also help you to cope a bit better if you can see your support having a positive impact on the person you care about. Caring for my husband with bipolar. Caring is lonely. It is an unrelenting task. Read Kate's story Look after yourself. Supporting someone else can sometimes be stressful. Making sure that you look after your own wellbeing can mean that you have the energy, time and distance you need to be able to help. For example: Set boundaries and don't take too much on. If you become unwell yourself you won't be able to offer as much support. (). Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone. Talk to someone about how you're feeling. You may want to be careful about how much information you share about the person you're supporting, but talking about your own feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too. Get support. You may be entitled to social care support from your Local Authority to help you care for your friend or family member. You can contact them directly and ask for a carers assessment (see our pages on carers' social care rights and how to cope when supporting someone else for more information). The charity Carers UK also provide more information and support for carers. Find more information on helping someone else: Specific diagnosis. For information on how you can support someone with a specific diagnosis, you can look up that diagnosis in our A–Z of mental health and visit the 'for friends and family' page within that information. Suicidal feelings. If your friend or family member is experiencing suicidal feelings, see our pages on supporting someone who feels suicidal. Helping someone seek help. For information on how you can support someone to seek help, including what you can do if they don't want any help, see our page on supporting someone else to seek help for a mental health problem."

"On this page: What are obsessions and compulsions? The OCD cycle. What mental health problems are similar to OCD? What's it like to live with OCD? What are obsessions and compulsions? Obsessions are unwelcome thoughts, feelings, images, urges, worries or doubts that keep coming into your mind. They may feel stuck in your mind, no matter what you do. You may worry what they mean or why they won't go away, and feel very distressed by them.  Compulsions are repetitive things that you do to reduce the distress or uncertainty caused by obsessions. Compulsions can be things you do physically, like repeatedly checking a door is locked. Or they can be things you do in your head, like repeating a specific word to yourself. Or they may involve others, such as asking people for reassurance.  Everyone can experience obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviours at times. But if you have OCD, your doubts and fears about your thoughts, and the things you do to feel better, can make you very distressed. And they can have a big impact on your life. It's not about being tidy, it's about having no control over your negative thoughts. It's about being afraid not doing things a certain way will cause harm. The OCD cycle. Compulsions might make you feel better at first. But you may find the more you do a compulsion, the stronger the urge is to do it again. This can lead to an unhelpful cycle of thoughts, feelings and behaviours. The diagram below shows how the cycle of OCD can feel. Everyone's experience of OCD is different, so this may not feel relevant to you. Or there may be parts that you find helpful and some that you don't. Obsessions can start with a difficult or unwelcome thought or feeling. This is sometimes called an intrusive thought. Everyone has intrusive thoughts. And if we accept them and leave them alone, they usually go away. But for those of us with OCD, we may start to question these thoughts or worry about what they mean. This means we're spending longer paying attention to them. And the more time we spend thinking about them, the more it might feel like they mean something. This can make us feel distressed, anxious or uncertain. Compulsions can start when we feel like we can't cope with our distress or doubt. We may have a strong urge to get rid of the thoughts or make ourselves feel better or surer about something. We may then do, say or think something to try and feel better. And this might work at first. We may feel relieved or comforted by what we did. And this might make us feel like the thing we did was helpful. But the relief doesn't last. The thought or feeling pops back into our mind again. And we feel distressed again. We may feel even worse because we don't understand why the thought has come back. So we do the thing we did last time to feel better. And it works again. But then the thought comes back, perhaps even quicker this time. As time goes on, we can spend more and more time worrying about our obsessions and doing our compulsions. And we can feel stuck in this cycle. Our page of self-care has more tips on managing OCD. No matter how many times I do something, I'll never feel like it's done and finished. My brain just won't let me. What mental health problems are similar to OCD? There are some other mental health problems that are similar to OCD because they involve repetitive thoughts, behaviours or urges. Perinatal OCD is when you experience OCD during pregnancy or after birth.  Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) involves obsessive worrying about one or more perceived flaws in your physical appearance. And developing compulsive routines to deal with worries about the way you look.  Compulsive skin picking (CSP) is the repetitive picking at your skin to relieve anxiety or urges. It can be experienced as part of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). You can read more about CSP on the OCD Action website. Trichotillomania is a compulsive urge to pull out your hair.

"On this page: What are intrusive thoughts? What are obsessions? What are compulsions? Types and examples of compulsions. Are there different types of OCD? How can I be sure I have OCD? What is 'Pure O'? What are intrusive thoughts? An intrusive thought is an unwanted thought that pops into your mind. You could experience the thought as a: Feeling or sensation. Memory. Urge. Mental picture. It may be triggered by something else. Or it might come into your mind for no obvious reason. Intrusive thoughts are very common. It's estimated that we have thousands of thoughts each day. Because we have so many different thoughts, some of them will be random, meaningless or confusing. Sometimes intrusive thoughts may feel scary, shameful or offensive. They might go against our values or beliefs. For example, you might get a thought about hurting someone. This could feel shocking and disturbing to you. We can't control or get rid of intrusive thoughts. But just because a thought comes into your mind, it doesn't mean you agree with it or that it's true. For those of us with OCD, intrusive thoughts can become obsessions. And the things we do to try to get rid of intrusive thoughts can become compulsions. You can find out more about coping with intrusive thoughts on our self-care for OCD page. Everyone has intrusive thoughts – they often pop into your mind and then disappear. But in the minds of those of us with OCD, they ruminate endlessly and, as a result, we believe it says something about who we are. What are obsessions? Obsessions are when our intrusive thoughts are very hard to manage. They make us feel very distressed and have a negative impact on our daily life. Our worries and doubts may feel stuck in our mind. We may worry about what they mean or why they won't go away. You might feel you can't share them with others or that there's something wrong with you that you have to hide. You might feel shocked or distressed that you're capable of having such thoughts. Remember: obsessions are not a reflection of your personality . People with OCD are very unlikely to act on their thoughts. I get unwanted thoughts all through the day, which is very distressing and affects my ability to interact with others and concentrate on my studies. What are compulsions? Compulsions are repetitive things that you feel you have to do to reduce the distress or uncertainty caused by obsessions. You might feel like you have to continue doing the compulsion until your distress or doubt goes away and things feel right again. You might know that it doesn't make sense to carry out a compulsion. But you still feel unable to resist doing it. Compulsions might make you feel better at first. But you may find the more you do a compulsion, the stronger the urge is to do it again. This can increase obsessions and distress in the long-term and can lead to an unhelpful cycle of thoughts and behaviours. Compulsions can feel very time-consuming, tiring and overwhelming. They may stop you being able to go about your daily life or do the things you want to do. Compulsions can: Be things you do physically. Be things you do in your head, such as rumination. When compulsions are internal and don’t involve physically doing something, some people refer to this to as Pure O. Involve a number, such as feeling like you have to complete a compulsion a specific number of times without interruption. Involve someone else, such as asking others for reassurance. Without realising it, I started doing rituals to try to get rid of these thoughts - my 'compulsions'. I had no awareness of what was going on. Types and examples of compulsions. Anything can become compulsive. If you can do, say, or think it, it can become compulsive. Sometimes the compulsion will be clearly linked to the thing you're worried about. And sometimes it will be less clear. The types of compulsions you do may change over time. Some examples of compulsions are listed below. Doing some of these things doesn't mean you have OCD. And you may have OCD but have different compulsions to those listed here. You can read our information on identifying your compulsions . Rituals. Washing your hands, body or things around you a lot. Touching things in a particular order or at a certain time. Arranging objects in a particular way. Saying things again and again. Checking. You might repetitively check: Doors and windows to make sure they are locked. Your body or clothes for contamination. Your body to see how it responds to intrusive thoughts. Your memory to make sure an intrusive thought didn't actually happen. Your route to make sure you didn't cause an accident when you travelled somewhere. Your phone or computer to see if you've sent something offensive or embarrassing. Correcting thoughts. Repeating a word, name or phrase in your head or out loud. Counting to a certain number. Trying to replace an intrusive thought with a different image. Trying to replace a negative feeling with a positive one. Doing something again and again until it feels 'right'. Reassurance. Repeatedly asking other people to tell you that everything is alright. Saying or doing things to test other people's reactions. Repeatedly apologising to people. Confessing your intrusive thoughts to people and asking what they mean. Constantly telling yourself that your intrusive thoughts aren't true. Rumination. Thinking about the same thing again and again. Trying to solve or fix your intrusive thoughts by thinking about what they mean. Doing research on the internet about your obsessions. Avoidance. Avoiding situations or people that make you anxious. For example, stopping driving to cope with intrusive thoughts about running someone over. Avoiding access to things. For example, removing anything from your home that could hurt someone. Delaying or putting things off (procrastination) to avoid feeling anxious or uncomfortable. Are there different types of OCD? Sometimes OCD is separated into 'types'. For example, you may hear people talking about 'contamination OCD' to mean obsessions and compulsions about dirt or germs. Some of us find it helpful to label our OCD in this way. It might make it easier to make sense of our OCD or to find others with similar experiences. Or we might find this type of labelling unhelpful. We may have obsessions and compulsions that don’t fit into a common 'type'. Or labelling our OCD as a particular type might make it harder to notice new obsessions or compulsions that don't fit this type. You may prefer to use the word 'themes' to describe the different topics of your obsessions and compulsions. You may have one theme, or lots of different ones. They may change or come and go over time. Some themes may bother you more than others. Some doctors or therapists may talk about different types of OCD. But different types of OCD are not separate diagnoses. That's the important thing to remember about OCD; it changes and develops with us. It'll always try to capture what we feel most insecure and vulnerable about OCD can attach to anything. If you can think of it, it can become an obsession or an OCD theme. Some themes are more common than others. But if you have a theme that's less common, this doesn't mean that your OCD isn't real. Or that you deserve support less than anyone else. These are some examples of OCD themes or types. Harming someone or violence. Worrying you've already harmed someone by not being careful enough. For example, that you've knocked someone over in your car. Worrying you're going to harm someone because you'll lose control. For example, that you'll push someone in front of a train or stab them. Violent intrusive thoughts or images of yourself doing something violent or abusive. These thoughts might make you worry that you're a dangerous person. Imagine the utter horror of taking someone's life. Now imagine having that thought over ten times a day - and not being able to get rid of it Relationships. Worrying about your relationships. For example, having doubts about whether a relationship is right. Or worrying people may dislike you or leave you. This can be about anyone in your life, including your partners, friends, family members or strangers. Sexual intrusive thoughts or images. These could be related to children, family members or to sexually aggressive behaviour. You might worry that you could be a paedophile or a rapist. Or that you're sexually attracted to someone in your family. Contamination. Contamination, for example by dirt, germs or faeces. You might worry that you've been contaminated and that you're spreading the contamination, or that other people are. Or you might worry that you have a disease, or might get one. Mental contamination. You might experience feelings of dirtiness, discomfort or feeling incomplete. These feelings may be triggered by a certain person, place or object. They may also be triggered by your own thoughts, images or memories. Actions such as touching an item belonging to someone else would lead to obsessive thoughts of myself coming to harm Your identity. Worries or doubts about your identity. For example, having obsessions or compulsions about your sexuality or gender identity. Or having constant doubts about your beliefs or values. Worries about whether you're a bad person. For example, constantly checking whether you've thought something bad, worrying you may say something offensive or constantly thinking about things you regret from the past. Obsessions relating to your body. This could include constantly worrying about how you look or feel. Or feeling very conscious of physical sensations like blinking or swallowing. When thoughts are intrusive, when they're negative, they can kind of feel like, does this make me a bad person?... Does the nature of these thoughts make me vile? The future. Worries about the future. For example, getting intrusive thoughts about you or a loved one getting ill or hurt. Or something bad happening in the world. Fear that something bad will happen if everything isn't 'right'. For example, if things are not clean, in order or symmetrical. The worst things you could imagine happening to your baby were in my head. For days I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I barely functioned. Anxiety and arousal. Intrusive sexual thoughts may lead you to constantly monitor and check your genitals. This attention and the anxiety you're feeling may actually increase blood flow and physical arousal. This can make you feel as if you are aroused by the intrusive thoughts when in fact the opposite is true. Many people with this type of OCD call this 'groinal response'. How can I be sure I have OCD? It's understandable to want to be sure about whether you have OCD or not. Especially if it's helped you get the support and understanding that you need. Or if it helps you feel less alone or ashamed about your intrusive thoughts. But for those of us with OCD, our need for certainty can make our symptoms worse. It's very common for those of us with OCD to worry about whether we really have OCD. This is sometimes called 'meta OCD'. You might have intrusive worries or doubts about whether your OCD is real or serious enough. You might worry that you’ve lied to people or wasted people's time by seeking support. Or you might worry that you're using OCD to cover up the fact that your intrusive thoughts are true. You may then use compulsions to try to cope with these worries. This could include ruminating about whether you have OCD, or seeking reassurance from others. Or you might research OCD on the internet, or stop your treatment to test whether your symptoms get worse. This can have a big impact on recovery. If you're struggling with this, try to remember that we can never be certain about anything. This includes whether we have OCD or not. And try to resist compulsions if you can. Our pages on treatment and self-care have information on seeking support and managing symptoms. What is 'pure O'? Pure O stands for 'purely obsessional'. People sometimes use this phrase to describe a type of OCD where they experience distressing intrusive thoughts. But they don't have any external signs of compulsions, such as checking or washing physical things. The name is slightly misleading as it suggests that there are no compulsions at all. With pure O, you still experience compulsions. But rather than things you do physically, they will be things you do in your mind. Because they're sometimes not as obvious as physical compulsions, they can be harder to spot. Or it can be hard to define exactly what these compulsions are. These are some examples of mental or internal compulsions: Checking how you feel - for example, you might check to see if you are still in love with your partner. Checking bodily sensations - for example, you might check to see if you were aroused by an intrusive thought. Checking how you feel about a thought - for example, you might check whether you're still upset by the thought. Repeating phrases or numbers in your head. Checking if you still have a thought - for example, first thing in the morning. Thinking about a problem over and over. Reassuring yourself over and over again that you're a good person or that your thoughts aren't true. You can read more about pure O on the OCD-UK website . Getting ready involves so much hand washing and so many mental rituals. Sometimes, I feel like staying in bed and avoiding the day."
"On this page: What are stigma and misconceptions? Stereotypes about OCD. Trivialising OCD. False ideas about OCD being useful. Feeling guilt or shame about OCD. Coping with stigma about OCD. What are stigma and misconceptions? You may experience different types of stigma or misconceptions around OCD. Stigma is a negative opinion or belief about a certain characteristic or experience. This can include stigma about having a mental health problem. Misconceptions are beliefs or ideas which are inaccurate. They're often based on inaccurate, misunderstood or misleading information. Experiencing these can be frustrating and upsetting. Especially if they come from a friend, colleague, family member or healthcare professional. We may also hold negative opinions about our own mental health. This is sometimes called self-stigma. Stereotypes about OCD. There are lots of unhelpful stereotypes and misconceptions about OCD. For example, some people think it just means you wash your hands a lot or that you like things to be tidy. When there are so many incorrect stereotypes about OCD, it can be harder for those of us with OCD to recognise the symptoms in ourselves. And it may make it harder to explain our experiences to others. Misinformation about OCD may stop genuine sufferers from realising that they even have OCD. I lived with OCD for twenty or thirty years before realising it, and that’s not an unusual story. Trivialising OCD. OCD is often trivialised. Some people might make jokes about it or describe themselves as a 'little bit OCD'. Or companies might use OCD stigma in their advertisements. For example, using phrases like 'Obsessive Christmas Disorder' to sell Christmas products. The everyday drip-drip-drip of jokes, comments and put-downs - in your office, classroom, your home, and on social media - creates an overall impression that OCD is something quite trivial, or comical, and not a serious illness. False ideas about OCD being useful. Some people have misconceptions about OCD being useful or meaning that you're very organised. You may hear them saying they wish they had OCD or that you're lucky to have it. I’ve made a spreadsheet - ‘I’m so OCD!’ These are all things I’ve heard in casual and professional conversations Feeling guilt or shame about OCD. You may feel guilty about your thoughts and feelings. If you find your intrusive thoughts offensive or shameful, you may feel like you can't share them with anyone. You may worry about how people will react. Or you may worry about whether your thoughts are true or what they mean. You may also feel guilty about things you've done or said when unwell. Having these sorts of feelings about your OCD can lead to self-stigma. It could also make it harder to seek support. Countless people with OCD hide their symptoms because of the nature of their thoughts. You do not need to suffer in silence. Coping with stigma. Stigma about OCD can make it difficult to talk about. But it's important to remember you're not alone. There are things you can do to support yourself, and people who can help. There are also ways to help change other people's understanding. Here's some ideas you could try: Show people this information to help them understand more about OCD. Get more involved in your treatment. Our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem give guidance on having your say in your treatment. They also cover making your voice heard, and steps you can take if you're not happy with your care. Know your rights. Our pages on legal rights have more information. Take action with Mind. See our campaigning page for details of the different ways you can get involved with helping us challenge stigma. Share your story. Sharing your experiences with others can be a powerful way to raise awareness. You could do this through peer support groups or you could share your experiences online. Be kind to yourself if you feel self-stigma or feel guilty about intrusive thoughts. Our self-care for OCD page has more information. Our page on stigma and misconceptions around mental health includes more information on dealing with stigma. One of the most difficult things about OCD is how people perceive it. Intrusive thoughts and compulsions take a greater toll, yet people don't seem to understand that."
"On this page: Personal experiences and OCD. Biological factors and OCD. Even though we don't fully understand what causes OCD, it can still be successfully treated.  Personal experiences and OCD. Some theories suggest that OCD is caused by personal experience. For example: If you've had a painful childhood experience, or suffered trauma, abuse, discrimination or bullying, you might learn to use obsessions and compulsions to cope with anxiety. If your parents had similar anxieties and showed similar kinds of compulsive behaviour, you may have learned OCD behaviours as a coping technique. Ongoing anxiety or stress could trigger OCD or make it harder to manage. Pregnancy or giving birth can sometimes trigger perinatal OCD.  Biological factors and OCD. Some theories suggest that OCD may be caused by something physical in our body or brain. These are sometimes called biological factors. Some biological theories suggest that a lack of the brain chemical serotonin may have a role in OCD. However, it's unclear whether this is a cause or an effect of the condition. Studies have also looked at genetic factors and how different parts of the brain might be involved in causing OCD. But they haven't found anything definite. You can read more about the causes of OCD on the OCD-UK website . Is childhood OCD caused by an infection? Some experts have noted that some children seem to develop OCD symptoms very suddenly after having a streptococcal (or strep) infection. For example, strep throat or scarlet fever. This is sometimes referred to as PANS (Paediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome) or PANDAS (Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus). More research is needed into why this can happen and the best options for treatment. You can find more information and support from the charity PANS PANDAS UK ."
"On this page: Managing intrusive thoughts and uncertainty. Managing compulsions. Using distraction and visualisation. Improving your wellbeing. Connecting with others. Managing OCD can be an ongoing process. You may find that there are times where things feel manageable and other times where it's much harder. Try to be patient with yourself. And remember that different things work at different times. If something isn't working for you or doesn't feel possible just now, try something else. Or come back to it. If you try any of the tips on this page and they start to become compulsive, read our information What if my self-care becomes compulsive? There are still days where I struggle. I am constantly aware of my thoughts and it’s something I think about, and will have to live with everyday. But OCD doesn’t stop me from doing anything. Managing intrusive thoughts and uncertainty. These tips can help to manage intrusive thoughts, and find ways to cope with uncertainty. Try to accept intrusive thoughts. It's understandable to want to get rid of thoughts that you find distressing or worrying. But often, the more we try to get rid of a thought, the more it comes into our mind. It can start to feel like the thought is stuck in our head, no matter what we do. Try to remember that intrusive thoughts are very common. Some studies have estimated that we have over 6,000 thoughts a day. And most people report that they sometimes have thoughts that bother them. Or that they find confusing, shameful or frightening. Try to sit with the thoughts that come into your head, rather than trying to get rid of them or make them better. It may help to name the thoughts. For example, you could think or say to yourself ""there’s that intrusive thought again"" or ""here’s that thought that makes me feel scared"". Some people find that if they exaggerate or make fun of their intrusive thoughts, it can make the thought less powerful. Try a grounding object. Keep a small object with you to hold and focus on when you feel bothered by your thoughts. For example, you could use a stone, a fidget toy or a piece of fabric. OCD UK sell 'just a thought' wristbands and badges to help remind you not to give meaning to every thought. I now always try and replace my thoughts with 'I’ve just had a thought that…' and it gives it less meaning than if I think, 'What if?'. Try not to attach meaning to every thought and feeling. Just because we have a thought, it doesn't mean that we agree with it or that it's true. Sometimes it's just a thought. Try to remember that you don't need to justify or explain every thought or feeling. Sometimes we just feel a certain way, and that's ok. Try to avoid black and white thinking. Remember that many things can be true at one time. For example, if someone you love is upset with you, this doesn't mean that you're a bad person or that they'll stop caring about you. To understand this, try to imagine you had the thought ""I’m a bad person"". It can help if you: Try not to argue with the thought – ""I’m not a bad person because…"". Try not to replace the thought – ""No, I’m a good person"". Don't push away or try to stop thinking about the thought. Try not to reassure yourself ""I’m not as bad as some people"". Avoid doing things to fix the thought, like doing a kind act to prove to yourself that you're a good person. All of the things above might make you feel better in the short term. But they still mean you're paying attention to the thought. Let the thought sit there. Try to accept that it's there and that it feels distressing. You don't need to agree with the thought. But try to accept that you can never be totally sure whether it's true or not. And try to remember that your distress won't last forever. As it happens, I am not a violent, murderous rapist. They were just intrusive thoughts. Accept uncertainty. Try to remember that almost nothing is certain. And that it's normal to have doubts. We can never be totally sure that our worries aren't true or that something bad won't happen. This can feel very upsetting and scary. But the more we try to achieve certainty, the more time we spend thinking about our doubts. This often makes us feel more anxious and uncertain. Accepting doubt doesn't mean something is or isn't true or that you don't care whether it's true. It just means that you're accepting that you can't be fully certain. Some people find it helpful to reverse the questions they're worried about. For example, rather than thinking ""Am I completely sure that I’m not a bad person?"", you might think, ""Am I completely sure that I’m not a good person?"". Remember that you're not responsible for everything. If you feel a great sense of responsibility, try to think of all the other parts of a situation that you have no control over. Focus on what you can and can't control. It may help to make a list of the things you can change, and the things you can't. Try to accept the things you have no control over. Remember that it's not always possible to 'follow our gut feelings' or 'trust our instincts'. This can be unhelpful for those of us with OCD. The things that make us want to act on compulsions often feel like our 'gut instinct'. I will still occasionally have strange unwanted thoughts suddenly enter my mind but these thoughts are totally outweighed by my belief that these intrusive thoughts are simply not worth worrying about. Managing compulsions. Try these tips to help manage your compulsions. Identify your compulsions. Recognising your compulsions is often a key first step towards managing OCD. Compulsions are things we do, say or think to try and make ourselves feel better. It can be hard to recognise compulsions, especially if we've been doing them for a long time or if they bring us comfort. Anything can become compulsive. It can be hard to work out when things stop being helpful and start becoming compulsions. For example, some people have told us that they struggled in the pandemic. They said it was hard to separate things they were doing to follow guidelines, from things they were doing because of their OCD. Some signs that something might be a compulsion include: It feels very urgent. You feel the need to do it, even if it doesn't make sense. You feel if you do it one more time, you'll feel better. Doing it makes you feel better at first, but then you need to do it again. You find yourself doing it more and more over time. You feel panicked or distressed about not being able to do it. You feel distressed or anxious while doing it. You feel like you don't have control over whether you do it or not. You feel a rush of relief or comfort after doing it. You feel stuck or trapped in the action, conversation or thought. You feel like a part of you doesn't want to do it, or you feel like you're watching yourself from outside of your body. You feel ashamed, embarrassed or guilty about doing it, but can’t stop. You can’t explain clearly why you need to do it, either to yourself or to others. You find yourself spending more and more time doing it. You keep thinking it will work, and then feel frustrated and disappointed when it doesn’t. You find yourself prioritising doing it over other things that are important to you, or it makes you act out of character or against your values. You may not feel all these things. Or there may be things you feel that aren’t listed here. I'm telling myself I'm doing the right thing because I'm following the guidelines. But where do I draw the line? Resist, delay or reduce compulsions. It may help to try finding ways to resist, delay or reduce your compulsions. These tips explain different ways to do this. Resist Try to sit with distressing feelings or thoughts without doing things to make yourself feel better. It will probably feel very unpleasant at first. This feeling may last a while, but it won’t last forever. Try to focus on accepting the feeling, rather than trying to make it go away. If you feel the urge to do a compulsion, or if you find yourself starting to, stop. Take a breath and try to resist doing it. Resisting compulsions is very difficult at first. But with practice, it does get easier. Try to remember that giving into compulsions will only make your OCD stronger. Do something to distract yourself. This may help focus your attention away from the urge to do the compulsion. Practise exposing yourself to things you fear and sitting with the difficult feelings without doing compulsions. It might help to schedule in a time to practise. Or you may prefer to try as things come up. If possible, it's usually safer and best to do this with the support of a trained professional, especially at first.  Remember, if you're actively exposing yourself to your fears, it's really important to also practise not doing the compulsions. If you're struggling with this or finding it's making you feel worse, it may be more helpful to stop and seek support from a professional. Start small. List all of the compulsions that you do. Then put them in order of the ones that you find most distressing or hardest to resist. Start by challenging the least difficult ones, and work your way up the list. Rather than doing a compulsion, try reacting to intrusive thoughts in a way that doesn't engage with them. For example, you could think or say to yourself, ""maybe"", ""that could be true, who knows"", or ""ok, but I can’t control that"". Try to practise challenging everyday compulsions. Even if it's not related to a distressing thought, practising resisting any compulsive urges might be helpful. Trust that you can cope. Difficult feelings or doubts can feel unbearable. But try to remember that you can cope and that you don't need to get rid of them to feel better. Delay If it feels impossible to resist, try delaying compulsions. Rather than doing them straight away, try to sit with your feelings for a short amount of time. Next time, try waiting a little longer. It may help to set timers. Just getting out of bed and having a cup of tea is enough. Battling with your head every second is hard enough without feeling remorse because you’re 'not using this time effectively'. Taking a breath is using time effectively. Reduce Another option is to reduce your compulsions. This could mean doing them less, for a shorter amount of time, or in a slightly less satisfying way. Try to reduce them more and more each time. If you have done a compulsion, you might still be able to challenge yourself by undoing it. For example, if you need to do things an exact number of times to feel safe or complete, you could do it one more time to challenge the compulsion. Try to avoid replacing a compulsion with a different compulsion. For example, if you compulsively check your phone to make sure you haven't sent something accidently, try not to replace this by avoiding using your phone. This is another form of compulsion. It will have the same effect of giving you temporary reassurance, which is unlikely to be helpful in the long term. Make notes for yourself. Remind yourself of what has worked and not worked in the past. This could be in a journal or on your phone. I read that the more I would try and run away from the thoughts, the worse it would get. I decided one day just to kindly allow the thoughts and to try and hold them in my awareness in a different way. Instead of reacting to them with hate, shame, and anger I noticed them with kindness and warmth. Using distraction and visualisation. These tips could help find ways to distract yourself from your compulsions. Distract yourself. When trying to resist compulsions, it may help to focus your attention on something else. There are many ways you can distract yourself. It could be doing something creative, watching a film or TV show, doing something practical or going for a walk. Different things will work at different times, so think about what might work best for you. Try not to wait until you feel 'ready' to distract yourself. When we're feeling distressed, the idea of distracting ourselves may feel impossible. Try making a start, even if you doubt it'll help. Take things slowly and try not to worry if you don't feel better at first. When distracting yourself, try to bring your attention to the moment. If your attention goes back to your worries, try to gently re-focus on the present. Try to focus on what you can see, hear, smell, taste or feel. It may help to name these things. For example, if you're watching TV, try focusing on what people are doing or saying, rather than worrying whether you’re enjoying the show. When doing an activity, it can help to say what you're doing out loud or in your mind. This can help focus your attention. Try visualisation. Visualisation is a way of imagining different scenes and environments. Some visualisation techniques may be useful for managing OCD. You could imagine the following: Your OCD is a separate person to you. Some people give their OCD a name. This may help you to separate yourself from your symptoms. Your OCD is an animal, monster, bully or object. You've put your OCD in a box or in the corner of the room. This may act as a reminder that you don't need to pay attention to it. Yourself without OCD. Try to think about how you might react to intrusive thoughts. Your intrusive thoughts are leaves in the wind. Or they're spam emails that you can notice but not pay much attention to. Eddy is my OCD. I have named my OCD because I need to talk to him. Improving your wellbeing. If you're struggling with your mental wellbeing, there are lots of things you can do to take care of yourself. Look after yourself. Think about what might make your OCD worse. This could include stress, lack of sleep, big changes, times of uncertainty, anxiety, hormones, or difficult events in the news. Positive things, such as big events or feeling happy may also trigger intrusive thoughts about something going wrong.

What we eat can affect how we feel, including our mood and energy levels.  Try to do some physical activity. Any kind of physical activity can help our mental health. It's important to find something that works for you. Visit our pages about physical activity and mental health to find out more, including activities you could try. Spend time in nature. This can improve our wellbeing. See our information about nature and mental health to learn more, including different ideas for being in nature. I know stress is my trigger and I know how dangerously easily I can get stressed. From little things like breakfast to bigger things like weekends away, there are a million thoughts and factors to stress about. It is a frustrating cycle which ultimately means I can get stressed about getting stressed. Be kind to yourself. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small. It may help to keep a journal where you record things that you're proud of or grateful for. Be patient with yourself. It might feel impossible at first, but the more you practise, the more you may find you can manage your OCD. Accept that setbacks happen. Take things one step at a time. You may have times where you can manage your symptoms better than at other times. Having more difficult times doesn't mean you’ve failed or gone backwards. Ups and downs are a normal part of managing OCD. Treat yourself with compassion. Managing OCD can be really difficult. Sometimes this might mean that you have less energy or time for other things in your life. It's ok to prioritise your mental health and do things at your own pace. Forgive yourself. OCD can sometimes lead to us doing or saying things that we regret. Or things that go against our values. Try to remember that we all make mistakes, especially when we're struggling with our mental health. It's ok to forgive yourself and move forward. Write a compassionate letter to yourself. You could acknowledge how distressing your thoughts and feelings are. But also remind yourself that you can get through this and manage your OCD. Focus on your values. Sometimes it can feel like OCD defines us as a person. But this isn't true. Try to focus on the things that matter to you. This could be your values, interests, opinions or passions. It's ok if we have doubts about our values, remember that nothing is ever completely certain or perfect. My OCD wants me to believe I'm a terrible person who can't do anything right. That makes it hard to do nice things for myself. But something simple, like cuddling my cat or listening to music, can make me feel calmer. Take care online. Be mindful around compulsive behaviour online. This could include spending lots of time searching for information online. Or constantly checking your phone. Or it might involve arguing with people or asking people for reassurance on social media. Comments we read online can trigger our doubts and fears. Try to remember that things are often more complicated than they seem online. Take regular breaks from the internet if you can. If there's content that you find distressing, or that you use in a compulsive way, try to stop or reduce the time you spend on it. Try to be purposeful about your time online. Ask yourself, are you checking your phone or doing an internet search because you need to? Or is it to reassure yourself or avoid a difficult feeling?  I would spend about 2-4 hours a day checking my phone and laptop… I had to shut my laptop 'correctly' and place it down on my shelf 'correctly' or again, I believed it would cause the laptop to post all sorts of humiliating things that'd ruin my life. If I wasn’t satisfied I would turn my laptop back on, and start the whole process again. Connecting with others. You might worry that people won't understand OCD. And it can feel scary to put some of your experiences into words. But talking about your OCD may help you feel less lonely and more able to cope. Connect with those around you. Talk to someone you trust about your OCD. Find a quiet space to talk where you won't be interrupted. You could show them this information to help them understand. Some people find it helpful to write their feelings down and then talk about this together. Tell people what you need from them. People may want to help but not know how. Try to be as open as you can about what you need. This might include helping you to resist compulsions, helping to distract you, or giving you some time to yourself. It may help to talk about this at a time when you're feeling well, so that you're prepared for more difficult times. Try to avoid asking for reassurance again and again. Asking for reassurance from others is a very common compulsion. It can be very difficult to resist in the moment, especially if you feel distressed. Instead of asking them for reassurance, try sharing that you're struggling with your OCD right now. Ask them to help distract you. If you can't resist asking them for reassurance, you could start by saying ""This could be OCD, but…"". This lets them know that it might be OCD. Develop code words or signs with people close to you. For example, you could have a name for your OCD that you both use. It may be easier to use this word in the moment, rather than trying to explain how you're feeling. Spend time with others. You might not feel ready to talk openly about your OCD yet. But spending more time with friends and family may help you feel more comfortable around them. And in time, more able to share your experiences. I cried for the whole day, so scared that no one could help me. My boyfriend had to come home from work and we drove to the countryside for a walk to distract me, which helped a little. Try peer support. Making connections with people with similar or shared experiences can be helpful. You could try talking to other people who have OCD to share your feelings, experiences and ideas for looking after yourself. For example, you could: Try an online peer support community, such as Mind’s Side by Side, OCD-UK's online forums or OCD Action's online forums. Find support through social media. Find a local support group through an organisation such as OCD Action, OCD-UK and Top UK. Check out our tips on peer support. If you're seeking peer support online, it's important to look after your wellbeing. We have more information about looking after your mental health online . I remember wishing I could just talk to someone who could tell me they had felt what I was feeling. Try self-help resources. Self-help resources for OCD are designed to help you develop coping strategies. They're often based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Make sure any resources you use are from a trusted organisation. You could try OCD-UK's self-help resources. You can ask your GP to recommend a self-help book from a Reading Well scheme. This scheme is supported by most local libraries. So you can go and check the books out for free – you don't need a prescription from a doctor. It is not easy. OCD is the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. But with the right help, I believe anything is possible. Please don't hesitate to seek help, wherever from. What if my self-care becomes compulsive? Anything can become compulsive. This could include any of the self-care tips listed on this page. For example, you may start to use peer support in a compulsive way to reassure yourself that you definitely have OCD. Or you may become compulsive about things like exercise or sleep. This can feel very frustrating and confusing. If you're worried this may be happening, try to use the techniques above to resist the compulsions. Or try to set boundaries with yourself. For example, you may limit the time you spend on a self-care activity. Or it may help to try something different for a while. If you're struggling, it may be better to seek support from your GP or a therapist if you can. How peer support saved my life. I didn't understand why I was obsessing over certain things or why such distressing thoughts kept entering my mind. Read Victoria's story"
"On this page: Talking therapy. Medication. Accessing treatment. What if I'm worried about talking to my doctor? Specialist OCD services. Social care support. Talking therapy for OCD. You may be offered talking therapy for OCD. This might be on its own, or along with medication. I started to learn how to manage my OCD when I spoke to a therapist. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with Exposure and response prevention (ERP). CBT with ERP is the most recommended talking treatment for OCD. It combines two types of therapy: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behaviour.  Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is designed to treat OCD. It encourages you to confront and accept your obsessions, and resist the urge to carry out compulsions. You may be offered CBT with ERP in person or over the phone. And it could be one-to-one or in a group. It depends on your needs and the services in your area. During ERP, your therapist may encourage you to do, say or think things about your obsessions or fears. Then they will help you to try to tolerate the distress or uncertainty, instead of doing a compulsion. Your therapist should help you do this at your own pace and support you along the way. They will usually start with smaller challenges and help you build your confidence in resisting compulsions. ERP aims to help you see that the uncomfortable feelings will eventually go away, even if you don't perform a compulsion. This type of therapy can be challenging. At first, it might make you feel more distressed. It may help to talk to a healthcare professional about any concerns before you start ERP. They can answer any questions you have about what it involves. Seeking therapy privately. Waiting times for therapy on the NHS can be long. And the services we need are not always available. Because of this, you may consider going private. Unfortunately, this can be expensive so may not be possible. Some private therapists offer a sliding scale of payment, depending on your circumstances. So it may be worth checking their website or contacting them to see if this is something they can do. It's important to find the right support for your needs. Certain types of therapy that focus on your past experiences or on finding meaning in your thoughts are not recommended for OCD. They can make symptoms worse. It may help to talk to any potential therapist and ask how much experience they have with treating OCD. Or it might help to search for people who include ERP within their therapy. Visit our page on seeking private therapy to find out more. I met with the psychologist and she showed me there was a way forward. Each week I challenged a compulsion and I became one step closer to being the me I used to be Medication for OCD. You may be offered the following medications for OCD, either on their own or alongside talking therapy: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) – this is a type of antidepressant. Research has shown that it can also help to treat OCD. Clomipramine – this is a tricyclic antidepressant. You may be offered this if you try an SSRI but it doesn't help. Different people find different medications helpful. You can talk to your doctor about your options. You might find you need to try out a few different types of medication before you find one that works for you. Medication helps some people. But isn't right for others. Before deciding to take any medication, it's important to have all the facts you need to make an informed choice. This includes information about any potential benefits and side effects of the drug. If you don't understand any aspect of a medication you're offered, don't be afraid to ask as many questions as you feel you need to. For more information, see our pages on things to consider before taking medication and your right to refuse medication . For guidance on how to come off medication safely, see our pages on coming off medication . I've been on meds for the last three years and my OCD is so much more controllable. How can I access treatment for OCD? The first step to getting treatment for OCD is usually to visit your GP. Your GP should ask about your symptoms and discuss different treatment options. If you live in England, you may also be able to refer yourself to an NHS talking therapies service directly. You can find your nearest NHS talking therapies service on the NHS website. This service offers treatment for depression, anxiety, and some other mental health problems - including OCD. Waiting times for this can vary, and can sometimes be long. The treatments you're offered will depend on how much OCD is affecting your life, and how much distress it's causing you. It may also depend on any treatments you've tried in the past, and whether these worked. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare – suggests that treatment for OCD should include talking treatments or medication, or both. The NICE website has full guidelines and recommendations for treating OCD . If you feel a treatment isn't working for you, it's a good idea to discuss this with your GP. There may be others available. What if I'm worried about talking to my doctor? You might feel scared about telling anyone, even a doctor, about your intrusive thoughts. You may worry you'll be judged about graphic or offensive thoughts. Or that the doctor might report you to the police or social services. Or you may find it hard to share how much time your compulsions take up. This might might make it feel difficult to get the right help. But it's important to be as open as possible, so you can access the best treatments for you . Before your appointment, it may help to note down the ways your OCD is affecting your life, how much your symptoms distress you and how much time they take up. This may help you to remember what you need to say in the moment. You could also ask someone you trust to go with you. We have more information about talking to a GP about your mental health . OCD Action also has a page on preparing for a GP appointment about OCD . And OCD-UK has a GP Ice Breaker that you can print, complete and take with you. Specialist OCD services. If your OCD is very severe and medication or talking therapy haven't helped, you may be referred to a specialist OCD service. Unfortunately, not all areas have specialist services and you might have to travel outside your local area. OCD-UK has more information about NHS specialist OCD treatment services . Social care support. Depending on how your OCD impacts your life, you may be eligible for social care. Social care services support people who struggle to manage day-to-day activities. You can read more about social care in our guide to health and social care rights ."

Be kind and patient with yourself. There's also information about what to do if their obsessions or compulsions are about you . Learn more about OCD. Find out as much as you can about OCD. This can help you understand what your friend or family member is going through. You can read more on our What is OCD? and OCD symptoms pages. Or get information from other charities, like OCD-UK and OCD Action. Look at blogs, videos or posts from people with OCD. For example, you can search for stories about OCD on our Your Stories pages. Remember that everyone's experiences are different. One person's experience of OCD may be very different to what the person you know is going through. Try to talk to the person about their OCD. No information will be able to fully explain what they're going through in the same way. Try to keep an open mind. OCD can be complicated and confusing. Your friend or family member may tell you things that worry or don't make sense to you. Try to remember that they may have kept their experiences secret for a long time. They may be worried about your reactions. Try to listen without judgement and let them know that you'll be there to support them. Challenge stigma if you can. There's still lots of stigma about OCD. If you hear or see someone talking about OCD in a way that stigmatises, stereotypes or trivialises OCD, try to challenge this. This could be through explaining your experiences or sharing our information on OCD stigma. It's not always easy or safe to challenge people, so if don't feel able to do this, that's ok too. It was so hard that instead of speaking out loud I showed them the stories and descriptions of the illness I found on Google and said this is what I have. This is where my recovery began. Recognise and understand compulsions. OCD has two main parts: obsessions and compulsions . Compulsions can make people feel better at first. But in the long-run, compulsions make OCD symptoms worse. One of the hardest things about supporting someone with OCD is working out how to help them resist compulsions. You might even help their compulsions without knowing it. For example, if you check things for them, give them repeated reassurance or help them avoid things they find distressing. This is sometimes called accommodation. It's natural to want to help someone, especially if they're distressed. You may feel guilty about not helping them. Or you might not know how else to support them. But the more you help someone with their OCD compulsions, the more they might feel like they need help. This can make their obsessions and compulsions stronger over time. Instead, it can help to try recognising their compulsions. They may have one main compulsion, or lots of different ones. These might change over time. Some signs they may be struggling with a compulsion include if they: Get distressed or agitated if they can't do something. Need to do something again, but the more they do something, the more they seem to need to do it again. Spend more and more time doing something. Have the same conversations with you, over and over again. Can't seem to let go or move on from difficult situations or feelings. Need to do things which don't make sense to you. Act out of character or against their values. Keep asking you for reassurance, apologising or asking if you're sure about something. Ask you to check something again and again. Seem more distracted or distant than normal at times. Avoid certain things. Struggle to manage daily responsibilities at times. My husband knows he has to tell me when I start collecting things and my daughter will remind me by asking if something is what I want or an OCD problem. Help them to manage compulsions. Managing compulsions can be a very complicated and difficult thing to do. But it's an important part of managing OCD. There are some things you can do to try to help: Agree on an approach that feels right for you both. For example, you might decide that you will say ""we've agreed I won't answer questions like that to help you manage your OCD"". Encourage them to challenge compulsions where appropriate. For example, you could try to remind them that compulsions are unhelpful in the long term. Resist giving reassurance. Seeking reassurance is a very common symptom of OCD that often involves those around them. For example, they may ask you whether they did something wrong. Or they may ask you to confirm that their memory of an event is true. Try to gently explain that you don't want to make their OCD worse by reassuring them. Try not to use logic to reassure them. For example, if they're worried that they've hurt someone, you might try to help by explaining all the reasons this is unlikely to be true. This might reassure them in the short term, but may make them feel the need to seek this reassurance again. Be gentle but consistent. In the moment, they may feel hurt or rejected if you don't help with their compulsions. Try to give gentle, simple explanations without getting into discussions about their obsessions. For example, you could say, ""I love you but we agreed that I wouldn’t help with this"" or ""I know this is hard, but I think this could be your OCD talking right now"". Use code words or signs if it helps. For example, you could plan a word or symbol between you to symbolise OCD. This may be useful to use in the moment when someone is distressed and struggling to explain their feelings. Try to validate their feelings, rather than help with compulsions. For example, you could say, ""I understand that you're feeling really upset right now"". Encourage them. Remind them of times when they've managed to resist compulsions in the past. Try to stay calm and patient. It's understandable to feel confused, upset or frustrated if we're seeing someone we care about in distress. But remember that by not engaging with compulsions, you're trying to help support them. Remember that resisting compulsions takes practice for you and them. Take things one step at a time. Help to distract them. Suggest things you can do together to take their focus away from their OCD. This could be things like watching a film or going for a walk. They may find it hard to believe a distraction will work in the moment. It may help to start an activity yourself and let them join in gradually. Offer a hug or other emotional support instead of helping with a compulsion. Compromise with the compulsions you help with at first. For example, if you help them with a number of compulsions, you may need to slowly reduce the number you do. Help delay the compulsion. For example, rather than offer reassurance straight away, you could ask them to wait a set amount of time before you talk. Try to increase the delay a little bit each time. Help them to reduce compulsions. For example, you could suggest ways they could spend less time on their compulsion, and encourage them to reduce them more and more each time. Try not to judge yourself if you sometimes help with compulsions. It's likely that this will happen at times. You may need to do so in a crisis situation or it may happen without you realising. Try to think about how you could manage that situation differently in the future. Your first thought is why aren't they helping me check... but if you step back, breathe, you realise they are not helping because they care. Work together. When they're feeling well, talk and plan for times when they might struggle in the future. It might help to write your agreed plans down. For example, you may want to go through the above tips about resisting compulsions together and decide which ones might work best. Use visualisation. It may help to think of the OCD as something or someone separate. You could suggest they give their OCD a name that you both use. This might help you to explain that it's the OCD you don't want to help, not them. Share your own intrusive thoughts. People with OCD can feel very ashamed and alone about the thoughts they experience. It may help if you share some of your own intrusive thoughts if you feel comfortable doing so. This might help them realise that having them is common. Learn more about intrusive thoughts. Try to avoid minimising their feelings or saying things like, ""just don’t worry about it"". Instead, try to acknowledge that they're struggling right now. Think about whether you've taken on too much responsibility. If you feel like you're doing too much for them, try to take a step back and encourage them to do certain things themselves. You may need to do this in small steps. Try to sit with their distress. It's understandable that you want to help someone feel better when they're upset. Especially if they're directly asking you for help. But accepting difficult thoughts and feelings is a big part of managing OCD. Rather than trying to fix their problem or make their distress go away, try to help them accept it and sit with it. Try to work together and be consistent if you're part of a group supporting someone, for example, a family or group of friends. Always include the person you're trying to support when you're making decisions about how best to support them. Help them to get treatment. People can find it difficult to talk to their GP about their OCD and seek treatment. Here are some ways you could support them: Remind them that the appointment will be confidential and that the GP is there to help them get treatment. Help them practise what they're going to say to their GP. Or help them write notes to take with them to their appointment. Offer to go with them to speak to their GP. You can read more about supporting someone to seek help. Ask them what you can do to make things easier. Learning to manage OCD can be challenging. For example, they may feel agitated, tired, anxious or depressed before or after attending therapy sessions. Seek advice on how to help. If they're getting treatment, you could both talk to their GP or therapist about the best ways you can help them manage their symptoms. Offer hope. They may feel that things will never get better, especially if they're finding treatment hard. Or if they experience setbacks. Remind them that many people with OCD do benefit from treatment. They may find it helps to read about people who are successfully managing their OCD, or have recovered from OCD, in Your Stories. I have never liked asking for help or telling people, even those close to me, how I'm feeling, so even as I grew up I avoided seeking support. Be kind and patient with them. Try not to judge. Remember that their fears are very real to them, even if they seem unrealistic, irrational or extreme to you. Celebrate wins with them, no matter how small. If you've noticed that they've coped with a situation well, tell them. Or you could celebrate ways that you've coped well together. Focus on the whole person. OCD can have a big impact on self-esteem and take over people's lives. Try to recognise and celebrate other things about them or your relationship. Remember that they're trying. Coping with OCD is not straightforward. Someone may be managing their symptoms well for some time and then have a setback. This can feel distressing and frustrating to watch. But try to remember that they're not choosing to struggle. And that they may be feeling very confused and distressed too. Try to remind them that setbacks are a normal part of managing OCD and encourage them that they can cope. Encourage them to be compassionate with themselves. OCD can come with a lot of guilt and shame. Encourage them to treat themselves with kindness. I could feel loved ones' frustration at my need to still carry out these compulsions, despite us both knowing it was illogical. Be kind and patient with yourself. Take time to look after yourself too. Supporting someone with OCD can be frustrating and upsetting at times. Find out more about looking after yourself in our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else and improving your wellbeing. You can also visit the Carers UK website. Share experiences, ask questions and get support from other people in the same situation. The OCD Action forum and OCD-UK forum have sections for family, friends and carers. You might find these helpful. Think about what you can and can't control. It may help to write things down. As much as you may want to help, you cannot be completely responsible for someone else's mental health. All you can do is try your best to support them. Ask for support. If you're struggling, reach out to others and ask for help. This could be through people close to you, or through your GP or a therapist. Take things one step at a time. You're not always going to do or say the right thing and that's ok. If you don't manage a situation as well as you could have, try to forgive yourself and move forward. Try not to be hard on yourself. Supporting someone with OCD can come with a lot of guilt. If you resist helping someone with compulsions, you may feel guilty about their distress. And if you do help with compulsions, you might feel guilty for not resisting. Try your best and remember that OCD management takes practice and patience, both for the person experiencing it and for those supporting them. It took my wife a long time to learn how to deal with my mental health, and I know it's really hard to understand OCD unless you're living with it. What if their obsessions or compulsions are about me? Anything can become obsessive or compulsive. And OCD can often attach to things that are most important to people. This includes the people they love. Obsessions and compulsions about relationships are very common. This is sometimes called 'relationship OCD'. This can impact any relationship, including partners, friends and family members. You may sometimes find that their OCD starts to become about you, or your relationship with them. For example, they may develop obsessive worries that you no longer care about them. They may compulsively ask you to reassure them that you do. Or they may worry that they no longer care about you and may compulsively confess this to you. This can be very challenging. It may be harder to help them manage or resist these compulsions. It can be difficult to work out whether something is a real issue with your relationship or a symptom of their OCD. And it can also be hard to not take things personally if their worries or doubts are about you. Try to resist engaging in any compulsions, even if they're about you. If you think someone's distress could be due to OCD, try to delay any important conversations or arguments until they feel calmer. And take time out of the situation if you need to. Remember that your feelings and needs are important too. There's a reason why OCD is classed as 'the secretive disorder' because it is exactly that, and it put a huge strain on our relationship, but we have since worked through these issues together and are now moving forward."

"On this page: What is paranoia? Causes of paranoia. Is paranoia a mental health problem? Effects of paranoia. What is paranoia? Paranoia is when you feel like you're being deliberately harmed in some way, but there's no evidence, or very little evidence, that you are. We all experience suspicious thoughts about how others may harm us. But these thoughts are more likely to be paranoid if: No one else shares the suspicious thought. There's no evidence for the suspicious thought. There's evidence against the suspicious thought. You still have the suspicious thought despite reassurance from others. Your suspicions are based on events that can be misinterpreted. I find it really hard to trust people as my head tells me they're out to get me. What are some examples of paranoia? Everyone will have a different experience of paranoia. But these are some examples of common paranoid thoughts. You might think that: You're being talked about, laughed at or judged behind your back. Other people are trying to make you look bad or exclude you. You're at risk of being physically hurt or killed. People are using hints and double meanings to secretly threaten you or make you feel bad. Other people are trying to upset or annoy you. People are trying to take your money or possessions. Your actions or thoughts are being interfered with by others. You're being watched by people or organisations, either on or offline. You might have these thoughts very strongly all the time. Or you might have them sometimes, such as when you're in a stressful situation. They might cause you a lot of distress or you might not really mind them too much. If these thoughts are affecting your everyday life, you may be experiencing a mental health problem. See our information on treatment and support for paranoia if you'd like to get support. Our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem may also help. In paranoia, your fears become amplified and everyone you meet becomes drawn into that web. You become the centre of a threatening universe. What is a justified suspicion? Not all suspicious thoughts are paranoid. We all have good reason to be suspicious sometimes. Justified suspicions are suspicions that you have evidence for. And they can help to keep you safe. For example, if lots of people have been mugged in your area, it's not paranoid to think that you might be mugged too. You might then be more aware of your surroundings when going out. The evidence for your suspicions might be personal to you. But it can also come from a history of discrimination and prejudice. For example, if you're a young black man and you know that the police target more young black men for stop and search. In this case, it's not paranoid to worry that you might be stopped and searched yourself. It can sometimes be difficult to know whether your thoughts are paranoid or if they're justified suspicions. This is especially if someone else tells you that your thoughts are paranoid when you don't think they are. Our information on self-care for paranoia has tips to help you understand and make sense of your thoughts. Causes of paranoia. No one knows exactly what causes paranoia. It's likely to be a combination of different things, such as: Difficult experiences in your childhood such as being bullied or abused. Low self-esteem. Having mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Living in an environment where you might feel isolated from others. Having certain illnesses, including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. Not getting enough sleep. Taking recreational drugs and alcohol. Engaging with media reports of crime, terrorism and violence. Postnatal psychosis and me. I thought everyone was whispering behind my back and saying I was a bad mum. Read Charlotte's story Is paranoia a mental health problem? Paranoia is not a mental health problem itself. But it can be a symptom of other mental health problems. Lots of people have paranoid feelings at some point in their lives. But if paranoia starts to affect your everyday life, this may be a sign that you're experiencing a mental health problem and need support. Paranoia can be a symptom of psychosis . This can be part of a few mental health problems, including: Schizophrenia – a mental health problem related to psychosis. Schizoaffective disorder – a mental health problem where you experience psychosis as well as mood symptoms. Bipolar disorder – some people with bipolar disorder experience psychosis, most commonly during manic episodes. Postnatal psychosis – a type of psychosis that develops after someone gives birth. If you experience psychosis, you may experience paranoid delusions, which can be very frightening. They often relate to a feeling that someone wants to harm you. Paranoia can also be a symptom of some personality disorders , particularly in moments of extreme stress. And there are similarities between paranoia and anxiety . Anxiety can cause paranoia. Or it can lead to an increase in paranoid thoughts. Paranoid thoughts can also make you feel anxious. But there are differences between anxiety and paranoia. For example: People who have paranoid thoughts may be more likely to experience delusions or hallucinations than people with anxious thoughts. Paranoid thoughts usually focus on specific threats or potential harm from other people. Anxious thoughts can be about many different things. Effects of paranoia. You might do or feel certain things because of your paranoid thoughts. These things might feel helpful at the time. but in the long term they could make your paranoia worse: How you might act. These are some things you might do because of your paranoid thoughts: Safety behaviours Safety behaviours are things you might do because of your paranoid thoughts, to make yourself feel safer. For example, you might avoid certain people or places, or stay indoors a lot. These are also called safety-seeking behaviours. Safety behaviours could make you feel safer at first. This might make you do them even more. But this cycle can mean it's more difficult to try different ways of coping with scary situations. Or to test your beliefs and see if they are justified or not. Pushing other people away If you think someone is threatening you or wants to harm you in some way, you may not be able to trust them. You might push them away, distance yourself, or decide that you're better off without them. But this can make people treat you differently. They might try to avoid you. This could make it feel that your beliefs are justified. How you might feel. Experiencing paranoia may make you feel: Isolated or alone You might feel as if no one understands your thoughts. It can be hard if other people don't believe things that feel very real to you. You may find it difficult to make or keep friendships. This may feel even harder if your thoughts mean you avoid people and stay indoors a lot. Paranoia is a very lonely and very frightening illness – it strips people of their confidence. Worried and anxious People who experience paranoia might keep worrying or feeling anxious about the same thing. The more this cycle continues, the more vulnerable you are to paranoid thoughts. For example, you might have persistent thoughts and memories about someone hurting you in the past. And you may use this as evidence for feeling paranoid about someone hurting you in the future. Some people might describe a paranoid thought as a type of anxious thought. Both anxiety and paranoia can happen when you feel threatened by something. What really disturbed me was the strength of the panic that felt like being stabbed. I realised this thought was paranoid but it was the idea that I could think something as bizarre as this that was terrifying to me."

"On this page: Consider the basis of their beliefs. Don't dismiss their fears. Be there for them. Support them to seek help. Respect their wishes. Agree how to get help in a crisis. Look after yourself. Consider the basis of their beliefs. You might not think their beliefs are justified. But their paranoid thoughts may have developed from anxiety about a real situation or past experiences. Try to explore or think about whether there's a basis for their thoughts. This can help both of you understand how the thoughts have developed. The most helpful thing for me is to be taken seriously. On some level I know my beliefs can't be real, yet to me they are utterly terrifying. Treating the fear as very real, even if you can't go along with my reasons for the fear, is so important. Don't dismiss their fears. Their thoughts and feelings are very real to them. So try to understand how they feel, even if you don't agree that they're under threat. It's possible to recognise their emotions without agreeing with why they feel that way. For example, you could say something like 'Things sound really scary for you at the moment'. Be there for them. People experiencing paranoid thoughts may lack trust in others. Their actions may start to push away people in their lives, even if they don't mean to. For example, they may avoid social situations where you might see them. This can be really difficult, and it may leave you feeling upset and hurt. Try to remember that they're dealing with difficult moods, emotions and experiences. You can let them know you'll be there for them when they need you. It helps to deal with the agitation by focusing on the feelings, and giving general comforting phrases such as 'All is well, there is nothing to worry about, you are safe.' Providing distraction activities can also help to break the cycle of paranoia. Support them to seek help. You can't force anyone to get help if they don't want it. But you can reassure them that it's ok to ask for help, and that help is available.  Respect their wishes. Don't try and take over or make decisions without them. Try to respect their wishes, even if you feel that you know what's best. Agree how to get help in a crisis. They might struggle to talk about their experiences, or feel like they can’t open up. This means they may become very unwell before you realise they need help. If you're worried about them having a mental health crisis, you could suggest that they use their crisis plan , if they have one. Our information on crisis services explains more about how to get help for a crisis. Look after yourself. Seeing someone you care about experiencing paranoia can be distressing or even frightening. You may feel as if you have no time for yourself, but looking after your own wellbeing is important for you and for them. There are lots of ways to find support, for example through talking therapy or peer support . This may be available at a local Mind or a carers' group, such as Carers UK .  Looking after someone with paranoia is incredibly draining… having the same conversations day in day out. I learnt to be very clear and concise in my conversations with my father, to be very boundaried and always do what I said I was going to do, leaving no room for misinterpretation."
"What are personality disorders? Our personality is the collection of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that makes each of us the individuals we are. We don't always think, feel and behave in exactly the same way – it depends on the situation we are in, the people with us and many other interconnecting factors. However, if you experience significant difficulties in how you relate to yourself and others and have problems coping day to day, you may receive a diagnosis of personality disorder. Everyone is shouting at me, 'why do you find things so difficult? Why can't you just be normal?' and I try and explain that I'm on a tightrope way in the air, and they all have their feet on the ground, but they all just laugh. What are the signs of a personality disorder? You might be given a diagnosis of personality disorder if all of these apply: The way you think, feel and behave causes you significant problems in daily life. For example, you may feel unable to trust others or you may often feel abandoned, causing you or others distress in day-to-day relationships. You experience these problems across different aspects of your life. For example, you may struggle to start or keep friendships, to control your feelings and behaviour, or get on with people. There may be an intensity to your emotions that makes them feel frightening and overwhelming sometimes. These problems continue for a long time. These difficult patterns may have started when you were a child or teenager and can carry on into your life as an adult. These problems are not solely caused by a substance or a medical condition. For example, using drugs or medication can cause changes in people, as can the physical effects of experiences like head trauma. How I've managed to live with a personality disorder... or two. [It] doesn't mean that there is something wrong with my personality... it means that I think, feel and behave differently from most people. Read Rachel's story Does it mean there's something wrong with who I am? No. We all have parts of our personality that can cause us or others difficulties. What is different for people with personality disorders is the intensity of these difficulties and the fact that you might need extra support.  The important thing to remember is that we're not broken, we just think differently and experience the world in a different way... there's no shame in doing whatever we need to do to cope with our emotions in a safe and supportive way. Who can diagnose me with a personality disorder? You can only be diagnosed with a personality disorder by a mental health professional experienced in diagnosing and treating mental health problems, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist – not by your GP. If you speak to your GP about your mental health and they think you might have a personality disorder, they can refer you to your local community mental health team (CMHT) who will be able to assess you. Initially I took this diagnosis of BPD as an insult, a criticism of my whole being, but then I began to understand that it is just a diagnosis, an explanation of why I feel as I do. Just as in a medical situation the pain in my stomach being diagnosed as appendicitis means that I am ill, there is a reason for the pain and I can get treatment."
"What types of personality disorder are there? Currently psychiatrists tend to use a system of diagnosis which identifies ten types of personality disorder. These are grouped into three categories. Suspicious: Paranoid personality disorder. Schizoid personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder. Emotional and impulsive: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Borderline personality disorder (BPD). Histrionic personality disorder. Narcissistic personality disorder. Anxious: Avoidant personality disorder. Dependent personality disorder. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). Each personality disorder has its own set of diagnostic criteria. To get a specific diagnosis you must meet some of these criteria. The minimum amount you need to meet is different for different types, but it should always be more than one or two. If you meet criteria for more than one type this may be called mixed personality disorder . It is also possible to get a diagnosis without meeting the full criteria for a specific type. This is known as personality disorder not otherwise specified (PD-NOS) or personality disorder trait specified . A wide range of people may get the same diagnosis, despite having very different personalities and different individual experiences. Your experience of living with a personality disorder will be unique to you. A controversial diagnosis. Our understanding of what it means to experience a personality disorder is constantly evolving. It is a controversial diagnosis . People have different views about these terms, and not everyone agrees with using them. The important thing to remember is that the feelings and behaviours associated with personality disorders are very difficult to live with. However you understand your diagnosis, and whatever terms you prefer to use, you deserve understanding and support. Paranoid personality disorder. The thoughts, feelings and experiences associated with paranoia may cause you to: find it hard to confide in people, even your friends and family. find it very difficult to trust other people, believing they will use you or take advantage of you. have difficulty relaxing. read threats and danger (which others don't see) into everyday situations, innocent remarks or casual looks from others. This might become such a big problem in your life that you are given a diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder.  I suffer from extreme paranoia and most people find this extremely irritating and become angry with me when I'm paranoid. Schizoid personality disorder. Many people with schizoid personality disorder are able to function fairly well. Unlike in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder , you would not usually have psychotic symptoms . However, as a result of the thoughts and feelings associated with this diagnosis you may: find difficulty forming close relationships with other people. choose to live your life without interference from others. prefer to be alone with your own thoughts. not experience pleasure from many activities. have little interest in sex or intimacy. have difficulty relating to or are emotionally cold towards others. Schizotypal personality disorder. Everyone has their own eccentricities or awkward behaviours. But if your patterns of thinking and behaving make relating to others very difficult, you may receive a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. Unlike in schizophrenia , you usually would not experience psychosis . However, you may: experience distorted thoughts or perceptions. find making close relationships extremely difficult. think and express yourself in ways that others find 'odd', using unusual words or phrases, making relating to others difficult. believe that you can read minds or that you have special powers such as a 'sixth sense'. feel anxious and tense with others who do not share these beliefs. feel very anxious and paranoid in social situations, finding it hard to relate to others.  I always feel rather 'thrown' when someone doesn't do what I expect them to do. Knowing there are lots of ways in which the problem could be approached would have made me feel a lot more prepared for what came next. Antisocial personality disorder. It is natural to sometimes put our own needs, pleasure or personal gain before those of others around us. However, if these actions occur very frequently and you struggle to keep stability in your life, or you regularly act impulsively out of anger or lack of consideration for others, this could lead to a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. You may: put yourself in dangerous or risky situations, often without thinking about the consequences for yourself or other people. behave dangerously and sometimes illegally (you may have a criminal record). behave in ways that are unpleasant for others. feel very easily bored and act on impulse – for example, you may find it difficult to hold down a job for long. behave aggressively and get into fights easily. do things even though they may hurt people – to get what you want, putting your needs and desires above other people's. have problems with empathy – for example, you may not feel or show any sense of guilt if you have mistreated others. have had a diagnosis of conduct disorder before the age of 15. This diagnosis includes 'psychopathy' and 'sociopathy'. These terms are no longer used in the Mental Health Act but a 'psychopathy checklist' questionnaire may be used in your assessment. Life with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). As a child anger seemed to be my only way to express how I felt. Read Andrew's story Borderline personality disorder (BPD). Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD). We can all experience difficulties with our relationships, self-image and emotions. But you might get a diagnosis of BPD/EUPD if these feel consistently unstable or intense and cause you significant problems in daily life. You may: feel very worried about people abandoning you, and either do anything to stop that happening or push them away. have very intense emotions that can change quickly (for example, from feeling very happy and confident in the morning to feeling low and sad in the afternoon). not have a strong sense of who you are or what you want from life, with your ideas about this changing significantly depending on who you're with. find it very hard to make and keep stable relationships or friendships. act impulsively and do things that could harm you (such as binge eating, using drugs or driving dangerously). have suicidal thoughts. self-harm. feel empty and lonely a lot of the time. get very angry, and struggle to control your anger. struggle to trust other people. experience other mental health problems alongside BPD, including anxiety, depression, eating problems and post-traumatic stress disorder. When very stressed, sometimes you might: feel paranoid. have psychotic experiences, such as seeing or hearing things that other people don't. feel numb or 'checked out' and not remember things very well after they've happened (known as dissociation). BPD is currently the most commonly diagnosed personality disorder. You can read more about it on our pages on borderline personality disorder (BPD) . BPD is like having no emotional buffer. I can go from nothing to suddenly extremely overwhelming emotions and I struggle with expressing them healthily. Histrionic personality disorder. Most people enjoy being given compliments or positive feedback about their actions. But if you depend very heavily on being noticed, or are seeking approval so much that this affects your day-to-day living, you might get a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder. You may: feel very uncomfortable if you are not the centre of attention. feel that you have to entertain people. constantly seek, or feel dependent on, the approval of others. make rash decisions. flirt or behave/dress provocatively to ensure that you remain the centre of attention. get a reputation for being dramatic and overemotional. be easily influenced by others. After being told my diagnosis I was then able to understand how and why I behaved the way I did: my life made a little bit more sense. Narcissistic personality disorder. It is human nature to be aware of our own needs, to express them, and to want others to be aware of our abilities and achievements. These are not bad traits. However, if these thoughts, feelings and behaviours are very extreme and cause problems in relating to others, you may get a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. You may: believe that there are special reasons that make you different, better or more deserving than others. have fragile self-esteem, so that you rely on others to recognise your worth and your needs. feel upset if others ignore you and don't give you what you feel you deserve. resent other people's successes. put your own needs above other people's, and demand they do too. be seen as selfish and dismissive or unaware of other people's needs. Avoidant personality disorder. We all have things, places or people we don't like, or which make us anxious. But if these things cause so much anxiety that you struggle to maintain relationships in your life, you may get a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder (sometimes also called anxious personality disorder). You may: avoid work or social activities that mean you must be with others. expect disapproval and criticism and be very sensitive to it. worry constantly about being 'found out' and rejected. worry about being ridiculed or shamed by others. avoid relationships, friendships and intimacy because you fear rejection. feel lonely and isolated, and inferior to others. be reluctant to try new activities in case you embarrass yourself.  Dependent personality disorder. It is natural to need other people to care for us or give us reassurance sometimes. A healthy balance involves being able to both depend on others as well as being independent from others sometimes. However, if feelings and thoughts about needing others become so overwhelming that they impact your daily life and relationships, you may get a diagnosis of dependent personality disorder. You may: feel needy, 'weak' and unable to make decisions or function day-to-day without help or support from others. allow or require others to assume responsibility for many areas of your life. agree to things you feel are wrong or you dislike to avoid being alone or losing someone's support. be very afraid of being left to fend for yourself. have low self-confidence. see other people as being much more capable than you are. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is separate from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) , which describes a form of behaviour rather than a type of personality. However, similarly to OCD, OCPD involves problems with perfectionism, the need for control, and significant difficulty being flexible in how you think about things. You may: need to keep everything in order and under control. set unrealistically high standards for yourself and others. think yours is the best way of doing things. worry about you or others making mistakes. feel very anxious if things aren't 'perfect'.  You can also find more information about OCPD on the OCD UK website . Personality disorder not otherwise specified (PD-NOS). Everybody is individual and behaves in unique ways, so it is only natural to not fit neatly into the categories described above. If you experience some personality disorder traits but not enough to fully meet the criteria of a specific type, you may receive a diagnosis of personality disorder not otherwise specified (PD-NOS). This diagnosis may also be known as personality disorder trait specified (PD-TS). These names can sound like opposites, but they both focus on the fact that you have some personality disorder traits but not enough of one type."
"What causes personality disorders? Just as everybody's experience of a personality disorder is unique to them, the causes will be unique as well. There's no clear reason why some people develop the feelings and behaviours associated with personality disorders, and others don't. Most researchers believe that a complex mix of factors seems to increase the risk of developing or triggering these experiences, including: environment and social circumstances. early life experiences. genetic factors. Environment and social circumstances. The environment and social circumstances we grow up in and the quality of care we receive can affect the way our personality develops. You may experience difficulties associated with personality disorders if you've experienced: an unstable or chaotic family life, such as living with a parent who is an alcoholic or who struggles to manage a mental health problem. little or no support from your caregiver – this may be especially hard if you've experienced a traumatic event or situation. a lack of support or bad experiences during your school life, peer group or wider community, such as bullying or exclusion. poverty or discrimination. some form of dislocation, such as migration from abroad. I have narcissistic borderline personality disorder. At first it was difficult to accept that the problem was essentially me, my personality. But then being able to put it into perspective as a developmental flaw was much easier to accept – that it was simply the way I'd developed in response to my environment and the situations I'd experienced. Early life experiences. Our experiences growing up can affect our personality in later life. If you had a difficult childhood, you might have developed certain beliefs about the way people think or act and how relationships work. This can lead to developing certain strategies for coping which may have been necessary when you were a child, but which aren't always helpful in your adult life. If you have been given a personality disorder diagnosis you are more likely than most people to have experienced difficult or traumatic experiences growing up, such as: neglect. losing a parent or experiencing a sudden bereavement. emotional, physical or sexual abuse. being involved in major incidents or accidents. often feeling afraid, upset, unsupported or invalidated. Not everyone who experiences a traumatic situation will develop these problems however. Your unique reactions, as well as the consistency and quality of support and care you received, will make a difference. Similarly, not everyone who develops a personality disorder will have had a traumatic experience. Genetic factors. Personality is very complex and researchers currently don't know much about what makes up our personalities and to what extent genes play a part in this. Some elements of our personality are likely to be genetic. We are born with different temperaments – for example, babies vary in how active they are, their attention span and how they adapt to change. While some experts believe genetic inheritance may play a part in the development of personality disorder, others point out that it is difficult to know whether similarities in temperament and behaviour have been handed down the generations genetically or through the behaviour children were modelled as they grew up. More research needs to be done in this area."
"Why is it controversial? Our understanding of mental health problems is constantly evolving. So is the language we use when talking about them. The diagnosis of 'personality disorder' can be controversial because: specialists disagree about how to understand personality disorders. it doesn't take social context into enough account. the term itself can be stigmatising. Some people with this diagnosis hold the view that their feelings and behaviours are a reasonable, human reaction to going through difficult life experiences. So it's unhelpful and upsetting to call it an illness or 'disorder' in their personality. They argue that professionals should consider what in their life may have contributed to their difficulties, and help with these. Not focus on finding problems in them as an individual. On the other hand, some people find that getting this diagnosis helps them to name and understand their experiences, to explain themselves to other people, and sometimes get treatment and support they otherwise might not. Mind is committed to ensuring that voices on all sides of this debate are heard. This includes those who: understand their experiences and behaviours as a disorder. think of them as a natural reaction to adversity. reject the personality disorder label. do not fully agree with the label but accept it being as a way to access support. If you have been diagnosed with a personality disorder but you're concerned that this isn't right for you, we have information on what you can do if you think your diagnosis is wrong . Specialists disagree about how to understand personality disorders. The system of personality disorder diagnosis we list on our page on types of personality disorder is the one psychiatrists tend to use in the UK. However, some psychiatrists disagree with its use and find it unhelpful because: Most people who are diagnosed with a personality disorder do not fit any one category, and may be diagnosed with more than one. Some people believe the focus should instead be on what each person needs in order to deal with their problems and discover new ways of living, not what category they are in. It doesn't take social context into enough account. People are complicated. There are many social factors that can affect our capacity to cope, to relate to others and to respond to stress. For example: Experiencing trauma in childhood (such as abuse or neglect), or trauma that lasted for a long time. Issues to do with your situation and environment, such as poverty and social deprivation, or having to move home to a totally new place or culture. Experiencing stigma and discrimination, like racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia or transphobia. If people have treated you badly in past relationships (including your parents or carers). Any of these can lead to you often feeling overwhelmed with unbearable feelings. This can make it very difficult to deal with the daily challenges of adult life. For more information on how traumatic experiences may affect your mental health, see our pages on trauma . The term itself can be stigmatising. Some people feel that the term 'personality disorder' can sound very judgmental. Being given a diagnosis or label of personality disorder can feel as if you're being told there's something wrong with who you are. You may feel upset, insulted and excluded. Language evolves and it may be that a different term will be used by professionals in future. Stigma can sometime come from the professionals themselves, whether intentionally or not. It's important to remember that you're not alone – there are other people out there experiencing what you are. However you choose to make sense of your difficulties, you deserve to be treated fairly. Here are some options you can consider: Show people this information to help them understand more about what your diagnosis really means. Get involved in your treatment – our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem and advocacy provide guidance on having your say in your treatment, making your voice heard and steps you can take if you're not happy with your care. Know your rights – our pages on legal rights provide more information. Take action with Mind – see our campaigning page for details of the different ways you can get involved in helping us to challenge stigma. That said, it takes energy to challenge stigma. When you are particularly unwell you may not have the capacity to do any of these things. Be kind to yourself and try not to put yourself under pressure to do anything other than rest and recover when that is what you need. See our advocacy page and useful contacts page for more information if you need support with having a say in your treatment. The stigma of being violent and dangerous is the worst for me. I am a caring and empathetic soul who would do anything for the people I love. Could my diagnosis be wrong? Some symptoms of personality disorder can be very similar to, or appear alongside, other mental health problems . Depending on your mood and what's happening in your life when you speak to mental health professionals, they might find it hard to identify the diagnosis that best fits your experiences. If you're worried that your diagnosis doesn't reflect the way you feel, it's important to discuss it with a mental health professional so you can make sure you're getting the right treatment and support to help you.

If you're feeling depressed, sad or lonely add remove What you could do to get through it: get comfy and watch your favourite TV show. read a favourite book. write all your negative feelings on a piece of paper and scrunch or tear it up. listen to a song or watch a video you find uplifting. write a comforting letter to the part of yourself that is feeling sad or alone. cuddle a pet or a soft toy.  If you're feeling anxious, panicky or tense add remove What you could do to get through it: make yourself a hot drink and drink it slowly, noticing the taste and smell, the shape of the mug and its weight in your hand. take ten deep breaths, counting each one out loud. write down everything you can think of about where you are right now, such as the time, date, colour of the walls and the furniture in the room. take a warm bath or shower – this can help change your mood by creating a soothing atmosphere and a distracting physical sensation.  If you're feeling dissociative or spaced out add remove What you could do to get through it: breathe slowly. listen to sounds around you. walk barefoot. wrap yourself in a blanket and feel it around you. eat or sniff something with a strong taste or smell.  If you want to self-harm add remove What you could do to get through it: stick sellotape or a plaster on your skin and peel it off. hold ice cubes where you want to hurt yourself. have a very cold shower.  Not everyone finds the same things helpful. It's possible for people to find their own coping methods. Using techniques I don't find helpful is actually very distressing, as is being told I have to do them. What can I do in the longer-term? Taking some time to make your wellbeing a priority can make a big difference to how you're feeling. Here are some ideas: Talk to someone add remove It can be hard to reach out to people when you are not feeling well, but sharing difficult thoughts can often make them seem a little easier to handle. If you don't feel comfortable talking to people around you, you could try contacting a helpline. For example, you can talk to Samaritans for free on 116 123 or email [email protected] about anything that's upsetting you.  Keep a mood diary add remove Monitoring your moods will help you understand more about yourself and your mood patterns, and to recognise changes which might be hard to spot otherwise. Many people use mood diaries to do this. It's also helpful to identify the good things that you've done or have happened to you. It's important to be practise being kind to yourself and note the positive steps you've taken or techniques that help. Sometimes I have good periods where my symptoms don't really trouble me – at other times, they can be overwhelming. It's sometimes hard not to beat myself up for the relapses, but that's something I need to keep working on. It's ok to struggle sometimes. Plan for difficult times add remove You might not always feel able to tell people how you're feeling or what help you need so it's a good idea to create a crisis plan that explains what you would like to happen in an emergency. This could include: who to contact. what treatments you would like to have or avoid. at what point you would like people to consider hospital treatment as an option. There are many different types of crisis plan. See our information on planning for a crisis and making a support plan for more information. Contact an advocate add remove If you feel like you're not being listened to or treated fairly (such as when talking to doctors or accessing treatment) an advocate can help you have your voice heard.  For more ideas about caring for yourself when you're feeling unwell, see our pages on self-care for a mental health problem . Make a self-care box add remove You might find it helpful to have some things that help you when you're struggling that you can access easily – a bit like making a first-aid kit for your mental health. For example: favourite books, films or CDs. a stress ball or fiddle toy for releasing agitation. helpful quotes or notes of encouragement. pictures or photos you find comforting. a soft blanket or cuddly toy. a nice-smelling candle or lavender bag. I learned distraction techniques. My favourite one was my Positivity Book, which is kind of like a scrap book filled with things which make me happy. Find coping strategies for self-harm add remove If you have a personality disorder, you may be self-harming as a way of dealing with very difficult feelings or overwhelming situations and experiences.  Try mindfulness or relaxation exercises add remove This could help you to feel calmer and manage unhelpful thoughts.  I learnt to be kind to myself and that life can be different if I put the work in. Some days I forget what it feels like to be positive and hopeful for the future, but I know it won't last. I deserve to be happy and live a fulfilled life and I'm not about to let an illness take that away from me. Try peer support add remove Talking to others with similar experiences to you can be helpful. Peer support gives people a chance to share their experience, give and receive support and hear and learn from others. There are lots of ways to find peer support. You could: see our peer support directory. ask your local Mind about peer support. try an online peer support community like Side by Side and have a look at our information about staying safe online. Look after your physical health add remove Your physical health can make a difference to how you feel emotionally so it's important to look after it wherever possible. For example, it can help to: Try to get enough sleep. Sleep can help give you the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences. Try to get to know and respect where your limits are and how much rest you need to feel well - take lots of extra rest if you need it.  Think about your diet. Eating regularly and healthily can make a difference to your mood and energy levels.  Try to do some physical activity. Exercise, including gentle exercise, can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing. It doesn't have to be anything vigorous, try a short walk or even some chair-based exercises.  Spend time outside. Spending time in green space can have lots of positive effects on your wellbeing.  Avoid drugs and alcohol. While you might want to use drugs or alcohol as a distraction from difficult feelings, in the long run they can make you feel a lot worse and can prevent you from dealing with any underlying problems that the drug or alcohol use may have been masking.  Find specialist support for any social issues contributing to your distress add remove Some people with personality disorders have had very difficult experiences which have contributed to their distress, such as abuse, bullying or discrimination. If you've experienced issues like these, it could be helpful to explore any help out there for these too. For example, if you have been abused in childhood, the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) has some support services, and our pages on abuse and PTSD list many other organisations that could help."
"What treatments are available? There are a range of treatments that can help you if you experience a personality disorder. These include: talking therapies. therapeutic communities. medication. For information on how to access treatment for a personality disorder and how to have a say in your treatment, see our information on: getting access to treatment. having a say in your treatment. Can things improve for me? Sometimes people assume that it's impossible to change, especially when it comes to our personality. But research is showing that this isn't the case. With time and the right treatment for you, it is possible for things to change and improve. All my life I have felt different, alienated and completely alone. It is only since my diagnosis of BPD that I began to understand why and, with help, to realise that I could actually do something to change those feelings and feel that I can achieve a life worth living. Talking therapies. More research needs to be done into which talking therapies can help people with personality disorders. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in health care – suggests that the following kinds of talking therapies may be helpful: Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) – a treatment specifically developed for borderline personality disorder (BPD). It uses individual and group therapy to help you learn skills to manage your emotions.  The one-to-one sessions I received were invaluable. My therapist was able to help me understand the DBT skills I was learning and help me to apply them to my life. My greatest lesson was to learn to fail and to accept that this and continued practise was the key to using DBT. Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) – a long-term talking therapy which aims to improve your ability to recognise and understand your and other people's mental states, and to help you examine your thoughts about yourself and others to see if they're valid. Mentalisation is best summed up as ""thinking about thinking"". It is being able to understand our own mental state and that of other people, and how this effects our behaviour. I identified with it immediately, as I really struggle with identifying what my emotions are and where they come from. NICE says that other types of talking therapy could also potentially be helpful, including the following: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – aims to help you understand how your thoughts and beliefs might affect your feelings and behaviour.  Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) – combines CBT's practical methods with a focus on building a trusting relationship between you and your therapist who will help you make sense of your situation and find new, healthier ways to cope with your problems. Other talking therapies – such as schema-focused cognitive therapy, psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy or arts therapies.  Therapeutic communities. Therapeutic communities are programmes where you spend time in a group supporting each other to recover, with the help of a facilitator. Most therapeutic communities are residential (often in a large house) where you might stay for all or part of the week. Activities can include different types of individual or group therapy, as well as household chores and social activities. The Consortium for Therapeutic Communities provides a directory of therapeutic communities in the UK. I spent 18 months as part of a Therapeutic Community, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's changed my life. My mood swings are far less frequent, and it's rare that they reach the extremes that they used to. Medication. There are no drugs specifically licensed for the treatment of personality disorders. Many people with personality disorders also have other mental health diagnoses though, such as depression , anxiety or psychosis , and may be prescribed medication for these. These medications could include antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilisers . Before you take any medication Before deciding to take any medication, make sure you have all the facts you need to feel confident about your decision. For guidance on the basic information you might want, see our pages on: what you should know before taking any psychiatric drug. receiving the right medication for you. your right to refuse medication. Where can I get treatment? Whether a treatment is available in your area will depend on where you live. To get treatment through the NHS you should first visit your GP, who can refer you to your local community mental health team (CMHT) for an assessment. In some areas there may be services that allow you to get in touch yourself and ask to be referred for treatment, which is called self-referral. You can talk to your CMHT for advice on self-referrals. If you receive NHS treatment, it should be in line with NICE guidelines . These say that: Anyone with possible personality disorder should have a structured assessment with a mental health specialist before being given a diagnosis. You should have a say in the type of treatment you're offered. If you're not getting the type of treatment you think would most help you, it could help to talk to an advocate.  Will I get the help I need in a crisis? Unfortunately, you might find that services in your area aren't always able to provide the type of care you might find most helpful straight away, due to pressure on services. We know how frustrating and difficult it can be to cope with services that don't provide the help you need, when you need it. That's why we're campaigning to improve crisis care across the country. You can learn more about our crisis care campaign here , and read about the different ways you can take action with Mind . Can I go private? Waiting times for talking treatments on the NHS can unfortunately be long. If you feel that you don't want to wait and you can afford the expense, or would like to see a therapist who specialises in the types of experiences you have had, you may choose to see a counsellor or psychotherapist privately.  How can I have a say in my treatment? A really important factor in your treatment is the relationship you form with the professionals who are helping you – whether they are a social worker, psychiatric nurse, therapist or psychiatrist. Having good treatment also depends on you being actively involved in it and having your say. You should expect to: Have your say in treatment – your GP or psychiatrist should discuss all your treatment options with you, and your views and preferences should always be taken into account when making decisions about your treatment.  Be involved in your care plan – a care plan is an agreement between you and the professionals you're working with, about what you want to get out of your treatment. It should include the problems you want help with, any treatments you may need and planning for a crisis. It was only when I met some dedicated professionals willing to go that extra mile that I started to change and believe in myself. I was able to begin therapy and develop a good trusting relationship which has been consistent and secure. When don't I have a choice in my treatment? You may not have a choice in your treatment if you: do not have mental capacity – this is where you are considered too unwell to make informed decisions about a specific situation – see our pages on the Mental Capacity Act for more information. are being kept in hospital under a section of the Mental Health Act (sometimes called being sectioned). are being treated under a Community Treatment Order (CTO) – this means you are given supervised treatment in the community. are being treated under a court order – this may be if you have committed an offence.

"How can other people help? This section is for friends and family who want to support someone with a diagnosis of personality disorder. If somebody you know is diagnosed with a personality disorder, their thoughts, feelings and behaviour might make it hard for them to always maintain a good relationship with you. Sometimes you may find it hard to know what to say or how to help. But there are lots of positive things you can do to support them: Try to be patient – if your loved one is struggling to deal with their emotions, try not to get involved in an argument in the heat of the moment. It could be better to wait until you both feel calmer to talk things through. I have become very aware of my feelings and emotions but I often find it really hard to control them, like someone's taken over my head for a short time I then feel overwhelmingly embarrassed of my actions, and push people away to try and make myself feel better. Talk to them compassionately and calmly – when someone is experiencing difficult thoughts and feelings, their behaviour may be unexpected or upsetting, and you may feel unsettled. Try to understand what they're experiencing and what's affecting their thoughts, feelings and behaviour – this can help you to stay calm. Don't judge them – try to listen to them without telling them they should feel the way they do or that they're being overly sensitive. You may not understand why they feel like this, but it can mean a lot to acknowledge and value how they're feeling. Validate and try to be understanding – don't question my thoughts or views. Put yourself in my shoes. If those were the thoughts and feelings you were experiencing, how would they make you feel? Remind them of other aspects of their personality – a diagnosis of personality disorder doesn't stop someone being likeable, intelligent, funny, kind, highly motivated or creative. It can be reassuring to remind them of the other things you see in them, particularly if they struggle to see these themselves. Try to both set clear boundaries and expectations – it can be helpful to make sure you both know where the boundaries of your relationship are, and what you expect from each other. This can help you both manage difficult feelings and situations. Agreeing how you expect to speak to each other, be spoken to or what you are or aren't able to help with could be useful things to clarify. Tell me a problem you're having, let me be there for you for a change. Don't hold back sharing difficulties in your life, I am your friend after all. It will make me feel valuable and useful. Plan ahead – it can be scary if you're worried someone you care about is hurting themselves, or is struggling with suicidal thoughts. Ask them how you could help when things are difficult.  Learn their triggers - talk to your loved one and try to work out what situations or conversations make them think or feel negative thoughts and emotions. Learn more about personality disorder, and help to challenge stigma – personality disorder is a complicated diagnosis, and your loved one may have to deal with other people's misconceptions on top of coping with their own mental health problem. Our pages about personality disorders and different types of personality disorder contain more information. Help them seek treatment and support – see our pages on how to support someone to seek help for more information. Help them find an advocate – see our pages on advocacy for more information. Take care of yourself – supporting a loved one who is struggling can be really difficult. Try to remember that your own mental health is important as well.  Sometimes, when we don't know who we are, we don't know why we are doing what we are doing, it just takes a person with hope to see something behind those eyes, something we cannot see ourselves, to save us and tell us that we can be okay."

"What is a phobia? A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder. It is an extreme form of fear or anxiety, triggered by a particular situation or object. A situation that triggers a phobia. You may know it's safe to be out on a balcony in a high-rise block, but feel terrified to go out on it. You might not even be able to enjoy the view from behind the windows inside the building. An object that triggers a phobia. You may know that a spider isn’t poisonous or that it won’t bite you, but this still doesn’t reduce your anxiety. You may even feel this extreme anxiety when you think or talk about the situation or object. Phobias and mental health. Many of us have fears about particular situations or objects. This is perfectly normal. A fear becomes a phobia if: the fear is out of proportion to the danger. it lasts for more than six months. it has a significant impact on how you live your day-to-day life. I wish I had a reason to explain to people where my phobia came from, but I don’t. I just handle it in the best way I can. When should I get help for a phobia? It can be difficult to know when to get help for a phobia. Bear in mind that phobias are a type of anxiety disorder . It may be time to consider treatment for your phobia if: avoiding the trigger object, situation, place or activity affects your everyday life, or causes you great distress. it keeps you from doing things you normally enjoy. it causes intense and overwhelming fear, anxiety or panic. you recognise that your fear is out of proportion to the danger. you’ve had the phobia for at least six months. it stops you getting support for other health problems – for example, a phobia that stops you using the phone or seeing the doctor. For more information, see our pages on self-care for phobias and treatment for phobias . It has taken me four whole years to realise that life doesn't have to be this way. I started psychotherapy. And it was when I discovered that there was another way of living."
"Types of phobia. Phobias can develop around any object or situation. Some people may experience multiple phobias. They can be broadly categorised into two groups: Specific phobias. Complex phobias. Specific phobias. These are phobias about a specific object or situation, such as spiders or flying. They often develop in childhood or adolescence. For some people, they might become less severe as they get older. Some fairly common specific phobias are: Animal phobias. Such as dogs, insects, snakes or rodents. Phobias of the natural environment. Such as heights, water, darkness, storms or germs. Situational phobias. Such as flying, going to the dentist, tunnels, small spaces or escalators. Body-based phobias. Such as blood, vomit, injections, choking, medical procedures or childbirth. Sexual phobias. Such as sexual acts or fear of nudity. Other phobias. Such as certain foods, objects or costumed characters. However, your phobia can be a completely unique experience. There are many more specific phobias than those listed above. How it might feel to experience a specific phobia If you're afraid of something you have to see or do a lot, this can start to have a serious impact on your everyday life. If your phobia is about something you don't come into contact with very often, this can sometimes have less of an impact on you. However, you may still experience fear and anxiety even when the object or situation isn't present. This means that your phobia can still affect you on a daily basis. Complex phobias. Complex phobias tend to have a more disruptive or overwhelming impact on your life than specific phobias. They tend to develop when you are an adult. Two of the most common complex phobias are: Social phobia. Agoraphobia. What is social phobia? If you have social phobia, you will feel a sense of intense fear in social situations. You will often try to avoid them. You might worry about a social event before, during and after it has happened. It is also known as social anxiety or social anxiety disorder. A lot of people find social situations difficult, or feel shy or awkward at certain times – this is completely normal. Social phobia however can completely overwhelm you. You might find it very difficult to engage in everyday activities such as: talking in groups. starting conversations. public speaking. speaking on the phone. meeting new people. speaking to authority figures, such as talking to doctors. eating and drinking in front of others. regular trips out, to the shops for example. going to work. I have suffered from phobias since I was three years old and couldn't cope with the social demands of a playgroup. I then went on to suffer from School Phobia right through to my teens, then various phobias surrounding college and work, which led to me becoming unemployed, isolated, agoraphobic and severely depressed. You might worry about these social situations because you fear that others will judge you negatively. Or maybe you fear that you'll offend others by something you say or do. You may also worry about others noticing that you are anxious. Social phobia can hugely affect your everyday life. It might: affect your self-confidence and self-esteem. make you feel extremely isolated. make it very difficult to develop and maintain relationships. interfere with your ability to work, or do everyday tasks like shopping. Lots of social phobia, but no friends When I walked through the door and was amongst other people, I couldn't even open my eyes. Read John's story What is agoraphobia? Many people think that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces, but it is more complex than this. Agoraphobia is feeling anxious about being in places or situations: that could be difficult to get out of. that could be embarrassing to get out of. where you might not be able to get help if you have a panic attack. You're likely to experience high levels of anxiety about everyday situations. You may also try to avoid these situations. Some examples include: being outside alone. being in open spaces. being in a crowd of people. travelling by car, bus or plane. being in enclosed spaces, such as a lift or in a shop. Having agoraphobia can have a serious impact on the way you live your life. Many people with agoraphobia find it hard to leave the place they live. How does agoraphobia develop? Agoraphobia can develop due to various reasons. One example is panic disorder, but not all people with agoraphobia have panic disorder. Agoraphobia can sometimes develop after a panic attack. You may start to feel extremely anxious and worried about having another one. In turn, you may feel your symptoms returning each time you're in a similar situation. To manage your anxiety, you may start to avoid that particular place or situation. Avoiding particular situations may help in the short term. But this can affect the way you live your life and may make your phobia worse. If you experience agoraphobia, it's also common that you might: dislike being alone, or monophobia. become anxious in small confined spaces, or claustrophobia. Escaping my agoraphobia I was scared to go out into public because I associated it with having panic attacks. Read Ellie's story"

"What causes phobias? There doesn't seem to be one particular cause of phobias. There are various factors that might contribute to developing a phobia. But there is not often a clear reason why it starts. Examples of causes of phobias. Past incidents or traumas. Certain situations might have a lasting effect on how you feel about them. For example, if you experienced a lot of turbulence on a plane at a young age, you might develop a phobia of flying. Or if you were injured by a dog some years ago, you might develop a phobia of dogs. Learned responses from early life. Your phobia may develop from factors in your childhood environment.

Being in a scenario involving your phobia can be very difficult though. You may need professional help to enable you to do this.

For more information, see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem . Talking treatments for phobias. During a talking treatment, you'll talk to a professional about your thoughts, feelings and behaviour. Your doctor or mental health professional can explain the options available to you. They can help you find the right talking treatment. Unfortunately, there is often a long waiting list for NHS talking treatments. For information on how to access them – through the NHS, charities or privately – see our pages on talking treatments .  Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to: identify connections between thoughts, feelings and behaviour. help develop practical skills to manage any patterns that are causing you problems. CBT can include a range of techniques when used to treat phobias. It may include exposure therapy (known as desensitisation). For more information, see our pages on CBT . You might follow a programme of CBT using a computer or workbook. You can do this as well as sessions with a therapist, or by yourself at home. This might be suitable if you experience social phobia or agoraphobia . For specific phobias , NICE recommends that computerised CBT should not be used routinely for treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy changed my life. Through using self-help books, to having professional CBT from my local Community Mental Health Team, I slowly learned how to change my negative thoughts to more realistic ones, and to finally overcome some of my deeply entrenched phobias. Exposure therapy Exposure therapy means gradually exposing you to the object or situation you fear. This is carried out in a safe and controlled way. For example, if you have a phobia of the dentist, in exposure therapy you might: read about the dentist. look at pictures of a dentist’s chair. sit in the waiting room. talk to the dentist. finally sit in the dentist’s chair. It's important that you fully understand the treatment and feel comfortable with your therapist. You will agree each of the steps in advance. This technique must be carefully managed to avoid causing distress and anxiety. Through repeated exposure, you may start to feel more control over your phobia. Exposure therapy may even be carried out using virtual reality (VR) tools. However, this type of treatment is largely still in its pilot stage. VR therapy and me I remember taking the headset off and starting to cry. I’d made it! It was a true breakthrough. Read Rochelle's story Hypnotherapy for phobias. Hypnotherapy uses hypnosis to try to change habits or treat certain conditions. Hypnosis involves putting you in a state of deep relaxation in order to access: subconscious beliefs. thoughts. memories. These are all factors which may affect the way you act.​ Hypnosis might help you to change unwanted thoughts and behaviours. It aims to do this through suggestion and by increasing your self-awareness. Some people with phobias find hypnotherapy helps relieve their symptoms. The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) has a register of hypnotherapists. They are trained to national standard level. To find a hypnotherapist, you can search the CNHC register by therapy type. See our list of complementary and alternative therapies for more information. Medication for phobias. If your phobia causes you severe anxiety , medication may be offered. There are currently three types of drugs considered useful in managing anxiety: Antidepressants. Tranquillisers. Beta-blockers. These are only available through your GP, not over the counter. Antidepressants To treat anxiety, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are most commonly prescribed. These drugs can be helpful, but may cause side effects like sleep problems for example. Unfortunately, you might find increased anxiety is another possible side effect. If SSRIs don't work or aren't suitable, you may be offered alternative medication. For social phobia, you may be offered a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant. It may be called moclobemide, or Manerix. Some foods can have a dangerous reaction with MAOI antidepressants. A warning about which foods to avoid is given with the drugs in the Patient Information Leaflet. For more information, see our pages on antidepressants and our A-Z of antidepressants . Tranquillisers To reduce severe anxiety, a benzodiazepine tranquilliser may be offered. Severe anxiety means it has a significant impact on your day-to-day life. The tranquilliser you may be offered might be called diazepam, or Valium. Benzodiazepines can be addictive. They should be taken at a low dose, for a short period of time. Preferably they should be a one-off dose and for no longer than four weeks.  Beta-blockers Beta-blockers are sometimes used to treat the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as: a rapid heartbeat. palpitations (a sudden irregular heartbeat, or flutter). tremors (shaking). You may be offered a beta-blocker called propranolol. Beta-blockers are not psychiatric drugs, so they don’t reduce psychological symptoms. But they might help in certain situations which trigger your phobia. Beta-blockers are not addictive. However they can cause side effects such as sleep problems and nightmares. If you decide to stop taking them, slowly reduce the dose. As they affect the heart and blood pressure, you should stop taking them gradually. "
"How to help someone with a phobia. This section is for friends and family who want tips to support someone who has a phobia. On this page: Try to understand phobias. Take their phobia seriously. Don't put pressure on them. Find out what helps them. Support them in seeking help. Remember to look after yourself. Try to understand phobias. Find out as much as you can about phobias. Doing this will help you understand what someone might be experiencing. Our information on phobias is a good place to start. Reading personal experiences from the Mind blog can help too. Try to learn about their experience of living with a phobia. You could ask them how their phobia affects their life, or what can make it better or worse. Listening to their experience might help you empathise with how they feel. Take their phobia seriously. It might feel hard to understand why someone has a phobia of a certain situation or object. Especially when their phobia seems irrational. However, it's important that you take their phobia seriously. Try to understand that their phobia can: cause severe anxiety. cause panic and distress. affect their daily life. You may not be able to see why they are so afraid of something. But the anxiety and fear they feel is very real. I never complain because I see no point in doing so, but I get very tired of being politely mocked for my fear. Don't put pressure on them. Avoiding a situation can make a phobia worse over time. But it can also be very distressing if someone is forced into situations they're not ready to face. It's important to be patient with them. You should work at a pace that suits them. Try not to pressure your friend or family member to do more than they feel comfortable with. Don't try to force them to be in a situation that triggers their phobia. My mother always brings up the discussion about me facing my phobia and maybe getting treatment for it. But for me, right now, I don’t want to face it. I feel I am not ready and I don’t feel it is impacting my life enough that it needs to be faced. Find out what helps them. Ask your friend or family member what you can do to help. For example, it might help to: take them out of the situation. talk to them calmly. do breathing exercises with them. This might help them feel safer and calmer when they start to feel frightened or panicked. Knowing that you are around, and know what to do, can feel reassuring. I feel better if I have someone with me who knows about my anxiety and how to calm me down. It helps if I just focus on that person talking. Support them in seeking help. If you think their phobia is becoming a problem for them, encourage them to seek treatment. Suggest to help arrange a doctor's appointment. If they're unable to leave the house, try to find out if their GP does home, online or phone visits.  Offer support when they attend appointments. You could offer to come along to their appointments and wait in the waiting room. It can sometimes help just to have someone accompany them. You can also help them plan what they'd like to talk about with the doctor. Our resource Find the words offers tips on talking to your GP about your mental health. Encourage them to seek help from a therapist. You can help them research different options.  Help them look into different options for support. Try finding out about community services, peer support groups or your local Mind. To find your local Mind, you can use our interactive map of local Minds.

You are not alone if you feel overwhelmed at times. It's important to try to look after your own mental health. If not, it can feel hard to find the energy and time you need to be able to help someone else. Set boundaries and don't take on too much. If you become unwell, you won't be able to offer as much support. Decide what your limits are and how much you are able to help.  Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone. Reach out to other friends and family, if the person is comfortable with you doing so. Talk to others about how you feel. Talking about your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too. Try to be careful about how much you share about the person you’re supporting.

"On this page: What are perinatal mental health problems? Managing existing mental health problems during pregnancy. Managing mental health problems with a new baby. What are perinatal mental health problems? A perinatal mental health problem is one that you experience any time from becoming pregnant up to a year after you give birth. Having a baby is a big life event. It's natural to experience a range of emotions. But if these feelings start to affect your daily life, this might be a perinatal mental health problem. This could be a new mental health problem. Or an episode of a problem you've experienced in the past. It can be difficult to know whether you're experiencing perinatal mental health problems. Especially if you've become a parent for the first time. Some of the symptoms that you experience may feel normal to you at first. You may feel like they're part of having a baby. This can make it more challenging to know when to seek help. You can visit these pages to learn more about individual perinatal mental health problems: Perinatal depression. Perinatal anxiety. Perinatal OCD. Postnatal PTSD and birth trauma. Postpartum psychosis. Some people also experience eating problems during and after pregnancy. Pregnancy charity Tommy's has information about eating disorders in pregnancy . It may also help to read our pages on eating problems . You may also experience mental health problems that aren't listed here.  What does 'perinatal' mean? 'Perinatal' means the time from the start of pregnancy to around a year after giving birth. You might also hear these terms: Antenatal or prenatal, meaning 'before birth'. This refers to the time when you're pregnant. Postnatal or postpartum, meaning 'after birth'. This refers to the first year after you give. I didn’t sleep and was constantly frightened that the worst was going to happen at any moment. But whilst this was all going on inside my head, I wanted to come across like I was doing OK Information for partners. If your partner is pregnant or recently gave birth, you may also experience mental health problems around this time.  We also have information about how to support someone who is experiencing a perinatal mental health problem . Managing existing mental health problems during pregnancy. If you have a mental health problem and you get pregnant, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor as soon as possible. It may also help if you're thinking of getting pregnant. This could be speaking to your GP. Or you could talk to any other doctor involved in your mental health care, like a psychologist or psychiatrist. This is because having mental health problems can increase your risk becoming unwell during pregnancy and after birth. This is especially if you've experienced severe depression , psychosis , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , or schizoaffective disorder . Your doctor can help you make plans to manage your mental health during pregnancy. They can also help you think about any extra support you might need. Our information on how to talk to your GP may help with having this conversation. I had been diagnosed with PTSD prior to my pregnancy. When I became pregnant with my daughter I had 'crisis' episodes and was referred to a consultant who helped me to identify my triggers. Managing medication during pregnancy. If you're taking medication, your doctor will talk to you about any risks and benefits. They'll also talk about how to manage medication during pregnancy and after having your baby. In some cases, your doctor may suggest that you stop taking certain medications to make sure your pregnancy is safe. If you decide to come off medication, or your doctor suggests this, it's important to do it safely. This should be with the support of your doctor. We have more information about antidepressants during pregnancy and antipsychotics during pregnancy . If I became unwell last time I was pregnant, will it happen again? If you experienced a mental health problem around a previous pregnancy, there's more risk that you'll become unwell again. This is particularly if you've experienced postpartum psychosis . But this doesn't mean you definitely will. If you became unwell previously, you might worry about having another baby. But you may also feel more confident in how to look after yourself. And you may know how to spot any signs that you're becoming unwell. If you get pregnant, or want to, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. You can discuss how to look after your mental health and the support you might need. Your doctor can also refer you to a perinatal psychiatrist. This is a specialist doctor. They can support you if you're pregnant or recently gave birth, and have experience of mental health problems. Action on Postpartum Psychosis (APP) has a series of guides about postpartum psychosis . This includes a guide to planning a pregnancy if you're at high risk of developing postpartum psychosis.  I also went on to recently have a baby girl a year ago and didn't experience this again. It proved to me that just because the first time had been an awful traumatic experience it didn't mean the second time had to be the same story. Managing mental health problems with a new baby. If you've recently had a baby, it may seem difficult to talk about how you're feeling. You might feel: Pressure to be happy and excited. Like you have to be managing everything well. Worried you're a bad parent. That other people will judge you for how you're feeling. Like you should be focusing on your baby instead of yourself. Scared that someone will take your baby away from you, if you're open about your feelings. But having mental health problems is not your fault. You can ask for help and support. Our page on perinatal support and services lists health professionals, charities and other organisations who may be able to help. Our page on self-care for perinatal mental health also has ideas that you can try for yourself. And our page for friends and family has tips for the people around you to support you during this time. It took a lot of courage to tell my midwife that I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and had sought help from my GP. Will I hurt my baby? If you experience thoughts about harming your baby, this can be very frightening. But remember that having these thoughts doesn't mean you are going to harm your baby. These thoughts can be a sign of perinatal depression , anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder . You might be afraid to tell anyone about these feelings. But the more you can talk about them, the sooner you can get support. This could be talking to a family member or friend. Or to a health professional like your doctor or midwife. Will my baby be taken away from me? You may worry that if you tell someone how you're feeling, your baby will be taken away from you. But having mental health problems and getting help doesn't make you a bad parent. And it doesn't mean that you're unable to care for your baby. Talk to your doctor, midwife or health visitor as soon as possible. They can help make sure that you get the support you need. Your baby will only be taken into care in extreme circumstances. It would happen if social services believe that your baby is at risk of serious harm or neglect. Healthcare professionals want to help and support you. It took me about 10 months to learn that I have always loved my son and he has always loved me. It was my mind making me believe that I didn't"
"On this page: Previous experience of mental health problems. Biological causes. Lack of support. Stigma and discrimination. Difficult childhood experiences. Experience of abuse. Low self-esteem. Stressful living conditions. Major life events. If your baby is unwell. We also have information about the effect of infant loss on your mental health . You might not feel like you can relate to any of these experiences. And you may not be able to identify what caused your perinatal mental health problems. That's ok. Sometimes we can develop perinatal mental health problems suddenly with no obvious reason. Previous experience of mental health problems. Your experience of mental health will be personal to you. As will your experience of being pregnant and having a baby. But if you've had mental health problems in the past, being pregnant or having a baby can increase the risk of those problems happening again. This includes any previous perinatal mental health problems. It's important to understand what might trigger another episode. And what support you may need during this time. You can speak to your doctor about this.  Biological causes. Some people suggest that perinatal mental health problems have a biological cause. This includes changes in your body during and after pregnancy, such as changes to your hormones. Some studies suggest that changes to your hormones during pregnancy and after giving birth can cause differences in your mood. But not everyone who gets pregnant and experiences these changes goes on to develop a perinatal mental health problem. So changes in hormones are unlikely to be the only cause if you do develop a problem. Lack of support. Having a baby is a major life event. It can be stressful, exhausting and overwhelming. If you don't have people around to help, this could affect how well you cope. It may mean that you're more likely to develop a mental health problem. The charity Gingerbread gives advice and practical support to single parent families. Home-Start can pair you with a volunteer who can visit to offer practical and emotional support. Our page of useful contacts has details of other organisations who can help you find support. Stigma and discrimination. Some groups can face stigma and discrimination which can affect our mental health. We have information that may help if you experience stigma or discrimination based on your sexual or gender identity . Or on your race or ethnicity . Difficult childhood experiences. Some of us have difficult experiences in our childhood, such as: Physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Neglect. An unstable family situation. Losing someone close to us. Research shows that these experiences could make you more vulnerable to perinatal mental health problems later in life. These problems include depression and anxiety. Childhood experiences can also have a big effect on how you feel about becoming a parent. For example, if your own parents didn't have good parenting skills, you may find it hard to adapt to your new role as a parent. You might feel unsure of how to interpret your baby's needs. You may even fear that you're not going to be there for them, because you aren't sure how to take care of them. For some people, these experiences can also make them more determined to be a better parent. However you feel, getting the right support can help. NAPAC supports anyone who's experienced abuse in childhood. This includes sexual, physical or emotional abuse, and neglect. I have PTSD due to trauma experienced in childhood... I worked so hard to fight my anxiety and accept my experiences, and to realise that these were very different to the circumstances in which I would be bringing up my daughter. Experience of abuse. Experiencing abuse can sometimes cause: Anxiety. Depression. Low self-esteem. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). So if you've experienced abuse, you may be more likely to develop perinatal mental health problems. Types of abuse include: Domestic violence. Verbal abuse. Emotional abuse. Sexual assault and rape. Violent assault. Financial abuse – for example, if a partner tries to have power over you by stopping you having control over your own money. Experiencing abuse could also affect how you feel about becoming a parent. For example, if you experienced abuse while growing up, you may now struggle to trust or relate to other people. This may mean that you find it difficult to relate to your baby, or bond with them. You might also have fears of abandonment related to abuse or trauma. This could make you worry about leaving your baby, or your baby coming to harm.  Low self-esteem. If you have low self-esteem, you may doubt your ability to cope as a parent. For example, when your baby cries you may think it's because of something you've done wrong. Or because of something important you haven't done. The way you think about yourself can make you more likely to develop perinatal mental health problems. For example, depression and anxiety . Our pages on self-esteem have more information. This includes ways to improve your self-esteem . Some of these tips might feel difficult while you're pregnant or have a new baby. But even small changes can make a big difference to how you feel. I was angry, sad, irrational, indifferent towards my husband... I lied and said things were better than the reality out of fear of being laughed at and being judged as a bad mother. Stressful living conditions. It can be difficult for anyone to deal with stressful living conditions. If you're pregnant or recently had a baby, this may feel even harder. These conditions can make you more likely to develop a perinatal mental health problem. For example, you may be struggling with: Money problems. Insecure or poor housing. Insecure employment. These problems can feel even more difficult if you live alone. Or if you have little or no support from other people. Our information about peer support and ways to make new connections might help. If you're living in these conditions, you may worry that you're unable to provide your baby with everything that they need. Or you might feel like you're failing your baby.  Major life events. Major life events can increase the level of stress in your life. Examples of major life events include: An illness or death in the family. The break-up of a relationship. Moving house. Losing your job. If you experience these while you're pregnant or after having a baby, you may be more likely to develop a perinatal mental health problem. Having a baby is also a major life event. It's likely to involve many changes in your life. You may leave your job or change your working hours. This can have a big impact on your finances. Or you may need to give up or reduce social activities, and find it difficult to spend time with friends. This can make you feel lonely, which could contribute to mental health problems. Our information on bereavement , money and mental health and loneliness may help. I think the fact that I had had 6 years of often traumatic infertility treatment before getting pregnant and that I had had a number of miscarriages contributed to my mental health issues… If your baby is unwell. Some babies become unwell after birth or are born early, and have to spend more time in hospital. This may be in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). For many parents, this can come as a shock. Having a baby on a neonatal unit can have a big impact on your mental health. It can be very distressing and can lead to symptoms of anxiety and postnatal PTSD, however long your baby is in hospital. You may feel powerless and guilty about not being able to do more to help. You may have to spend time away from your baby. And you're likely to be experiencing lots of different emotions at once, which can be challenging to manage. Or you may be grieving for what you imagined your birth or the first few days with your baby would be like. These are all very common feelings and experiences when having a baby in neonatal care. But they can develop into a mental health problem. The charity Bliss has more information for parents who have a baby in neonatal care. I looked at this little, tiny baby in an incubator, and I felt numb. Then the guilt and shock quietly took over. Where was that all-consuming love people talked about? I felt sick. I didn’t know what to do. At the time I felt so ashamed. Infant loss and mental health. Experiencing infant loss can be extremely traumatic and can have a big effect on your mental health. This includes losing your baby through miscarriage, still birth or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It's important to remember that you don't have to cope alone. There is support out there. You can get more information and support from these organisations: The Lullaby Trust. Tommy's. The Miscarriage Association. Sands. "
"On this page: Talk to someone you trust. Build your support network. Find ways to manage daily tasks. Look after your wellbeing. Try to take things slowly and do what you feel you can manage. If you don't feel ready to try these tips, you can always come back to them later. Talk to someone you trust. Talking to someone about how we're feeling can help. It can feel uncomfortable to talk about something so personal. But explaining how your feelings are affecting your life may help others to understand. And they may be able to help. Our information about seeking help for a mental health problem has tips for talking about your mental health. Admitting out loud that I had a problem was the hardest and best thing I have ever done. Build your support network. It can be reassuring to talk to other new parents about how you're feeling. You may find that they've had similar feelings. Discussing your mental health with people who've had similar experiences is often called peer support. Research shows that peer support can lower feelings of depression and anxiety in new parents. It can also give you a chance to share skills. And get some emotional and practical support. This could help you feel more confident as a new parent. You might find that socialising with other parents makes you feel more anxious or stressed. It's important to only do these things if you want to and if you feel ready to. These are some ideas you could try. Go to local parent-and-baby groups. If you're feeling nervous about being around new people, try doing something based around an activity. This might make it easier to start talking to other parents. For example, you could try doing music or yoga. The National Childbirth Trust has some more information about finding a local parent and baby group near you . There are also antenatal groups for parents who are expecting babies. You can ask your midwife or doctor for more information about these. But don't feel under pressure to go to lots of groups. All parents are different, so do what works for you. If you're interested in going to a group but are feeling nervous, contact the class provider in advance. That way you know what to expect. You can take someone with you for support too. With my group though, it turns out that I am in fact, still nurturing. I’m still a friend and a mother, and I still care Seek support online. There are lots of online communities where you can share your experiences of being a parent and living with a mental health problem. Websites like netmums have forums where you can talk to other parents. You could also try Side by Side , Mind's online peer support community. Our pages on looking after your mental health online have tips on getting a good online/offline balance and staying safe. The only help I did get was anonymously online. It still helps me now and that's what kept me going really, connecting with people in online groups and reading advice. Contact specialist organisations. There are many organisations that have information and opportunities to find peer support: Organisations like Home-Start and NCT help new parents to develop their support networks and look after their mental health. Action on Postpartum Psychosis runs a peer support network for anyone with experience of postpartum psychosis. PANDAS runs support groups for perinatal mental health problems. OCD-UK and OCD Action run peer support groups and online forums where you can talk to other people living with OCD. OCD Action has an online perinatal OCD support group. The Birth Trauma Association offers peer support for postnatal PTSD. See our useful contacts page for other organisations that can help. Or you can contact your local Mind to see if they offer any peer support groups or other support in your area. Find ways to manage daily tasks. Coping with household tasks while pregnant or looking after a baby can be tough for anyone. But it can feel even harder if you're living with perinatal mental health problems. Finding ways to manage day-to-day tasks can help take the pressure off. It can also make you feel more able to cope with the symptoms of your mental health problem. These are some ideas which may help. Accept help. If there are people who want to give you practical help, try to accept it. Think about what would be most helpful to you. For example, help with shopping, cooking meals or cleaning. Cook meals in advance. When you're feeling well and have more energy, it can help to plan ahead for times when you don't feel well. You could batch-cook meals in advance and freeze them. Then you have access to fast and healthy meals when you're feeling unwell. You could also use a meal subscription service, if you can afford it. Or get food shopping delivered to your home. Take it slowly. It's easy to feel overwhelmed while you're pregnant or when you're looking after a baby. Try setting yourself 20 minutes to do as much of a task as you can. For example, throwing things in the washing machine or sorting through paperwork. Or you could write one thing down every day that you would like to achieve. This can make tasks feel more manageable. It can help you take advantage of getting a little bit done when you feel able. Be kind to yourself if you don't do something as you planned to. Or if you find yourself feeling worse again. Everyone has their own response and it's important to take things at your own pace. The person I found it useful to talk to was another mum of older twins, as she knew what it was like and had come through. She suggested only focusing on what you needed to do to get through the day rather than worrying too much about beyond that. Look after your wellbeing. It might feel hard to find time to think about yourself while pregnant or looking after a baby. Making small changes can help you look after your mental health. These are some ways to help take care of yourself. Set boundaries. Try to set boundaries with those close to you. This can help avoid things becoming too overwhelming. For example, if people would like to visit, you could tell them before that you only feel up to them staying for an hour or two. Or that you'd prefer for them not to touch or hold your baby, if this is something you're worried about. People will understand and want to support you. Recognise your triggers. Try keeping a diary of your moods and what's going on in your life. You don't have to write down very much. You could also try recording it. This might help you recognise patterns or notice what affects your mental health. You might find that certain experiences or people trigger flashbacks or other difficult feelings. It might help you notice what's happening before you become more unwell. And to know when to ask for support. Try not to compare yourself to other people. It can be easy to compare yourself to other parents and their achievements. On social media, we often only see positive images of parenthood. This can make us feel worse. Try to remember that you don't know what's happening behind the scenes. If you can, try to concentrate on yourself and your own needs. I had come from a big, responsible, job and yet this simple job, a job that billions of women took in their stride everyday, was proving too much for me Keep active. Physical activity can boost your mood. It can also distract you from any thoughts making you anxious. And it can help you feel like you're getting to do some things for yourself. Getting active could include going for a walk with the pram, dancing to music at home or doing gentle yoga. But remember that our energy levels will vary on different days. It's fine to slow down or take a break.  Take time to relax. You might feel like you have no time for yourself. Or that all you do is sit around at home. Try to take a bit of time to do something that makes you feel good, even if it's a few minutes. And think about what really helps you unwind, whether it's reading a book, watching TV or doing crafts. There are many other ways to relax.  My mental health is something I will always need to work on and improve at times. But I truly urge other mums to understand the importance of taking care of yourself. If you can do this, taking care of your children becomes more manageable"

The crisis team were there for me 24 hours a day. They visited me at home if I felt I needed a home visit, making sure I was eating and getting my daily exercise.

Mother and baby units (MBUs) are specialist psychiatric wards in hospitals. You might be admitted to an MBU if you have symptoms of serious mental health problems late in your pregnancy.

It was a mixture of hormones, lack of medication, worries about giving birth and sickness in the first trimester that contributed to my illness. What's the difference between the 'baby blues' and postnatal depression? The 'baby blues' is a brief period of low mood, feeling emotional and tearful around 3 to 10 days after birth. You're likely to be coping with lots of new demands and getting little sleep. It's natural to feel emotional and overwhelmed. This feeling usually only lasts for a few days and is generally manageable. Postnatal depression is a much deeper and longer-term depression. This usually develops within 6 weeks after birth. It can be gradual or sudden. And it can range from being mild to very severe. I felt selfish and guilty for feeling negative and low. This made me isolate myself further and compounded the problem.

Empty and numb. Isolated and unable to relate to other people. That you find no pleasure in life or things you usually enjoy. A sense that things don't feel real. No self-confidence or self-esteem. Hopeless and despairing. Hostile or indifferent to your partner. Hostile or indifferent to your baby. Suicidal feelings. You may also find that you: Lose concentration.

It was like coming out from a very dark place into a world of sunlight and joy and it was the best feeling ever. Medication. Your doctor may offer you medication if you have a history of mental health problems. Or if you're experiencing moderate or severe symptoms.

You may be referred to a specialist community perinatal mental health team. This is for people with severe postnatal depression where treatment isn't helping. If you're referred to this team, you may be offered additional treatments. This may include more intense CBT, different talking therapies, and other types of medication.

Your doctor may also suggest ECT if your health is at risk. Or if your baby's health is at risk. ECT can work very quickly, so doctors may advise that you have it shortly after giving birth.

"On this page: Signs and symptoms of perinatal OCD. Treatments for perinatal OCD. Our page on self-care for perinatal mental health problems has some tips for helping yourself. Signs and symptoms of perinatal OCD. OCD has two main parts: obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are unwelcome thoughts, feelings, images, urges, worries or doubts that keep coming into your mind. They may feel stuck in your mind, no matter what you do. You may worry what they mean or why they won't go away. And you may feel very distressed by them. Compulsions are repetitive things that you do to reduce the distress or uncertainty caused by obsessions. Compulsions can be things you do physically, like repeatedly checking a door is locked. Or they can be things you do in your head, like repeating a specific word to yourself. Or they may involve others, such as asking people for reassurance. It's normal to worry about your baby's wellbeing. And to want to protect your baby while you're pregnant and after giving birth. But if you start to experience obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours that affect your daily life and wellbeing, you may be experiencing perinatal OCD. The obsessions and compulsions are likely to relate to feelings about being a parent and your baby. Examples of perinatal obsessions. These include: Intrusive thoughts about hurting your baby, during or after pregnancy. Disturbing thoughts of sexually abusing your child. Fear of being responsible for giving your baby a serious disease. Fear of making the wrong decision – for example, about vaccinations or medical treatment. These thoughts can be very upsetting and frightening. But they're not your fault. Having an intrusive thought doesn't mean that you want to act on it, or that you will act on it . From a runny nose, my thoughts quickly spiralled to a chest infection, hospital, intensive care and eventually my baby dying. The anxiety and panic was unbearable. I never slept with worry. Examples of perinatal compulsions. These include: Excessive washing of clothes, toys or bottles. Avoiding changing soiled nappies because you're worried about accidentally touching your baby inappropriately. Keeping your baby away from other people in case they hurt them or contaminate them. Constantly checking your baby – for example, waking them up when they're asleep to check on them. Repeatedly asking people around you for reassurance that your baby hasn't been hurt or abused. Going over what happened each day to reassure yourself that you haven't hurt your baby. It can be hard to open up and talk to someone about your obsessions or compulsions. But there are treatments and support options which may help. Treatments for perinatal OCD. If you're worried that you're experiencing perinatal OCD, talk to your GP or health visitor. Your doctor should discuss treatment options with you, so you can make a decision together about the best treatment for you.  Talking therapy. CBT with ERP is the most recommended talking treatment for OCD. It combines two types of therapy: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Exposure and response prevention (ERP), which is a specific form of CBT used to treat OCD. ERP is a talking therapy that helps you understand how your OCD works and what you need to do to overcome it. Your therapist will help you confront your obsessions and learn how to resist the urge to carry out compulsions. We have more information on talking therapies , including finding a therapist. If there are long waiting lists for talking therapy in your area, your doctor may recommend that you explore an alternative to therapy .

"On this page: Why might partners experience mental health problems? Support for partners. Some doctors might say you're experiencing postnatal or paternal mental health problems. This is because your mental health has been affected by becoming a parent. But others might say the term 'postnatal' only applies to someone who gave birth. No matter how you label your mental health problems as a partner, you're not alone – and you deserve support. Overall it was a horrific time in our lives, for a total of around 18 months from falling pregnant to coming out the other side, which really put a massive strain on our relationship. Looking back, I'm not sure how we managed to get through it all. Why might partners experience mental health problems? There are many reasons why you might experience mental health problems after your partner has had a baby. Some partners talk about these challenges affecting their mental health: Extra responsibilities, such as additional housework or looking after several children. A difference of expectations from reality. Not feeling as supported or appreciated as your partner. Going back to work when you don’t feel ready to. Financial pressures. A changing relationship with your partner. Lack of sleep. Or you might find that there's no obvious cause. Your partner may also experience mental health problems during pregnancy or after giving birth. These could have an impact on your mental health. Support for partners. Sometimes you may feel like any support is directed to your partner, and not you. So it can be easy to ignore your own needs. This can make it feel hard to reach out for help. And could make you feel like you just need to get on with things. But your mental health is important too . You deserve understanding and support. And there are ways to get help. Speak to someone about your mental health. You can always talk to your GP about your mental health. This includes when your partner is pregnant or after your baby is born. Your health visitor is also there for you and your partner. Your doctor can refer you to local support services or talking therapies. They could also prescribe you medication for your mental health. It might also help to talk to other partners who know what you're going through. Some NHS trusts have local support groups you can join. Other organisations have forums or social media groups where you can meet and share with others. See our useful contacts page for organisations who can support partners. And visit our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem for more information about getting support. Self-care. There are some things you can do to look after your own mental health if you are feel like you're struggling. Our page on self-care for perinatal mental health has some ideas that may help. We also have an A-Z of mental health , which lists mental health problems that you may experience – as well as ways to get treatment and support, and how to care for yourself."
"It might feel upsetting if someone close to you is experiencing perinatal mental health problems. But try not to blame them for how they feel. Some people who experience perinatal mental health problems might struggle to ask for help. This may be out of fear that they'll be judged as a bad parent. Or that their baby will be taken away from them. Other parents may want support, but not know exactly what they need. This page has ideas for how you could help. Offer to spend casual time with them. Having some company can help them feel less isolated. This can be while they get on with daily tasks and look after their baby. Try to understand if they don't feel up to seeing or being around people at the moment. Just offering can sometimes be enough. Make time to keep in touch. If someone is struggling with their mental health, it can make a big difference to know you're thinking of them. And that you want to spend time together. For example, send a quick text if you don't think they feel up to a phone call. Or send a voice note on your phone that they can listen to when they're ready. Suggest activities that you used to do together. Becoming a parent can make some people feel like they're losing touch with their previous identity. See if you can find things to do together that you did before they became a parent. Or you could offer to look after the baby while they do something by themselves. For example, having a relaxing bath, watching a TV show they like, or getting some rest. Go to parent-baby groups or activities together. This can help if they feel nervous about going to a group on their own. You can start small. Offer to observe a class with them at first. Or go to talk to the instructor with them, so they have an idea of what to expect. Give them space. They might feel guilty if they don't have lots of time to spend with other people. Or if they're not feeling well enough to reply to messages. You could let them know that they only need to see or respond to you when they feel able. Or you can send them a message to tell them that you're thinking of them. And let them know they don't need to send a response. Learn about perinatal mental health. If you're worried about how to talk about their mental health, try reading the rest of our perinatal mental health pages to learn more. It might make it easier to talk about, especially if they're finding it hard to open up. Don't try to fix them. When someone we care about is struggling, it's natural to want to solve things for them. But being a parent comes with a lot of pressure. Try to avoid telling them what you would do or what they should do. Just being there can be enough. Listen to them. Try to keep the focus on them. Don't compare situations to other parents, or your own experiences and feelings. It's important that they can focus on their own needs. Don't judge them. If they open up about distressing thoughts or behave out of character, try not to judge them. It's likely to be very difficult for them to talk about these sorts of thoughts. They may already feel judgemental of themselves. Try to listen, reassure them and offer support where possible. Offer practical support. The best way to find out what they need is to ask them. But if they feel very low, they might find it difficult to know what they need. These are some things you could offer: Do cleaning, laundry and other household tasks. Help to cook and do the shopping. Remind them to take their medication, or help them take it on time. Look after the baby or other older children, so they can get some sleep or have some time for themselves. Help them with doctor's appointments. You could offer to sit in the waiting room with them or go to the appointment. Or you could offer to look after their baby or older children while they go to appointments. If they struggle to arrange appointments, you could help with this. You could also encourage them to have a conversation with their health visitor. And you could help them plan what they'd like to talk about. If you go with them, you could take notes to help them to remember the conversation.  Help them research different options for support. This could include peer support groups or parenting groups. "

"What is PTSD? Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health problem you may develop after experiencing traumatic events . The condition was first recognised in war veterans. It has had different names in the past, such as 'shell shock', but it's not only diagnosed in soldiers. A wide range of traumatic experiences can be causes of PTSD . When something traumatic happens in your life it rocks you to the core. The world is no longer a safe place. It becomes somewhere that bad things can and do happen. When is it diagnosed? When you go through something you find traumatic it's understandable to experience some symptoms of PTSD afterwards, such as feeling numb or having trouble sleeping. This is sometimes described as an 'acute stress reaction'. Many people find that these symptoms disappear within a few weeks, but if your symptoms last for longer than a month, you might be given a diagnosis of PTSD. Your GP might refer you to a specialist before this if your symptoms are particularly severe. I started experiencing symptoms of PTSD after my boyfriend died. I suffered extremely vivid flashbacks that could happen at any time, anywhere, and were deeply distressing… I threw myself into another relationship very quickly to try and avoid how I was feeling, but then also would not express much affection to my new partner. Are there different types of PTSD? If you are given a diagnosis of PTSD, you might be told that you have mild, moderate or severe PTSD. This explains what sort of impact your symptoms are having on you currently – it's not a description of how frightening or upsetting your experiences might have been. PTSD may be described differently in some situations: Delayed-onset PTSD. If your symptoms emerge more than six months after experiencing trauma, this might be described as 'delayed PTSD' or 'delayed-onset PTSD'. Complex PTSD. If you experienced trauma at an early age or it lasted for a long time, you might be given a diagnosis of 'complex PTSD'.  Birth trauma. PTSD that develops after a traumatic experience of childbirth is also known as 'birth trauma'.  If you experience some PTSD symptoms while supporting someone close to you who's experienced trauma, this is sometimes known as secondary trauma .  I couldn't understand why I felt like my brain wasn't functioning – I couldn't remember things, I couldn't process things. It was like my brain had just slowed down and ground to a halt. Experiences of facing stigma. There are lots of misconceptions about PTSD. For example, people may wrongly assume it means you are 'dwelling' on past events. They might even suggest that you should 'get over it' or 'move on'. But having PTSD isn't a choice or a sign of weakness, and it's important to remember that you are not alone. "
"What are the symptoms? This page covers: common symptoms of PTSD. flashbacks. other effects of PTSD. PTSD and other mental health problems. Each person's experience of PTSD is unique to them. You might have experienced a similar type of trauma to someone else, yet be affected in different ways. Common symptoms of PTSD. These are some common signs and symptoms that you might recognise. Everyone's experience is different, so you may experience some, none or all of these things. Reliving aspects of what happened This can include: vivid flashbacks (feeling like the trauma is happening right now). intrusive thoughts or images. nightmares. intense distress at real or symbolic reminders of the trauma. physical sensations such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling. Alertness or feeling on edge This can include: panicking when reminded of the trauma. being easily upset or angry. extreme alertness, also sometimes called 'hypervigilance'. disturbed sleep or a lack of sleep. irritability or aggressive behaviour. finding it hard to concentrate – including on simple or everyday tasks. being jumpy or easily startled. other symptoms of anxiety. My heart was constantly racing and I felt permanently dizzy. I couldn't leave the house and became afraid of going to sleep as I was convinced I was going to die. Avoiding feelings or memories This can include: feeling like you have to keep busy. avoiding anything that reminds you of the trauma. being unable to remember details of what happened. feeling emotionally numb or cut off from your feelings. feeling physically numb or detached from your body. being unable to express affection. doing things that could be self-destructive or reckless. using alcohol or drugs to avoid memories. Difficult beliefs or feelings This can include: feeling like you can't trust anyone. feeling like nowhere is safe. feeling like nobody understands. blaming yourself for what happened. overwhelming feelings of anger, sadness, guilt or shame. The lack of sleep and the sense of never being at peace are exhausting. Why does PTSD have physical effects? This could be because when we feel stressed emotionally, our bodies release hormones called cortisol and adrenaline . This is the body's automatic way of preparing to respond to a threat, sometimes called the 'fight, flight or freeze' response . Studies have shown that someone with PTSD will continue producing these hormones when they're no longer in danger, which is thought to explain some symptoms such as extreme alertness and being easily startled. Some people also experience physical symptoms similar to symptoms of anxiety , such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches. I thought I was coping quite well to start with. Then a few weeks after the event, I began experiencing unpleasant physical symptoms, similar to those of a heart attack: chest pain, tightness and dizzy spells so severe that I thought I would pass out. What are flashbacks? A flashback is a vivid experience in which you relive some aspects of a traumatic event or feel as if it is happening right now. This can sometimes be like watching a video of what happened, but flashbacks do not necessarily involve seeing images, or reliving events from start to finish. You might experience any of the following: seeing full or partial images of what happened. noticing sounds, smells or tastes connected to the trauma. feeling physical sensations, such as pain or pressure. experiencing emotions that you felt during the trauma. You might notice that particular places, people or situations can trigger a flashback for you, which could be due to them reminding you of the trauma in some way. Or you might find that flashbacks seem to happen at random. Flashbacks can last for just a few seconds, or continue for several hours or even days. You can read some tips on how to cope with flashbacks on our page on self-care for PTSD . I feel like I'm straddling a timeline where the past is pulling me in one direction and the present another. I see flashes of images and noises burst through, fear comes out of nowhere. My heart races, my breathing is loud and I no longer know where I am. Other effects of PTSD. If you are experiencing symptoms of PTSD, you might also find that you have difficulty with some everyday aspects of your life, such as: looking after yourself. holding down a job. maintaining friendships or relationships. remembering things and making decisions. your sex drive. coping with change. simply enjoying your leisure time. If you drive you may have to tell the DVLA that you have PTSD. For more information on your right to drive, including when and how to contact the DVLA, see our legal pages on fitness to drive . My behaviour changed and became erratic. I would alternate from wanting to shut myself away and not see or talk to anyone to going out to parties in the middle of the week and staying out late. PTSD and other mental health problems. It's common to experience other mental health problems alongside PTSD, which could include: anxiety disorders. depression. dissociative disorders. self-harm. suicidal feelings. I was also deeply depressed and experiencing huge amounts of anxiety, refusing to go anywhere alone or go near any men that I didn't know… I would lock my bedroom windows and barricade my bedroom door at night. "
"What can cause PTSD? The situations we find traumatic can vary from person to person. There are many different harmful or life-threatening events that might cause someone to develop PTSD. For example: being involved in a car crash. being raped or sexually assaulted. being abused, harassed or bullied - including racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia or transphobia, and other types of abuse targeting your identity. being kidnapped, held hostage or any event in which you fear for your life. experiencing violence, including military combat, a terrorist attack, or any violent assault. seeing other people hurt or killed, including in the course of your job (sometimes called secondary trauma). doing a job where you repeatedly see or hear distressing things, such as working in the emergency services or armed forces. surviving a natural disaster, such as flooding, earthquakes or pandemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic. traumatic childbirth as a mother, or as a partner witnessing a traumatic birth. losing someone close to you in particularly upsetting circumstances. being sectioned or getting treatment in a mental health ward. being diagnosed with a life-threatening condition. Evidence suggests that pandemics can cause psychological trauma. If you're looking for support during the coronavirus pandemic you can find more information on looking after your mental health in our coronavirus and mental health hub . I was mugged then about a year later I was on the Tube when the police were trying to arrest someone who had a gun. In neither experience was I physically injured – although in the second one I thought I was going to die and that I was going to see lots of other people die. Are some people more at risk of PTSD? Some factors may make you more vulnerable to developing PTSD, or may make the problems you experience more severe, including: experiencing repeated trauma. getting physically hurt or feeling pain. having little or no support from friends, family or professionals. dealing with extra stress at the same time, such as bereavement, money worries, racism, seeking asylum, homelessness or spending time in prison. previously experiencing anxiety or depression. If you experienced trauma at an early age or you have experienced long-lasting or multiple traumas, you might be given a diagnosis of complex PTSD. Racial trauma. The impact racism can have on your mind and body is sometimes described as racial trauma. There's no universal definition of racial trauma. Some researchers say that it should be included as part of PTSD. Others say that it should be separate from PTSD, to reflect the specific traumatic experiences and effects of racism. But however you choose to define your experiences, it is always ok to ask for help with your mental health. I was diagnosed by my GP with PTSD a few weeks after the death of my father who died very suddenly, following a family outing to the local pub for lunch. He collapsed in front of us and we had to administer CPR at the scene while waiting for the ambulance. He died later on the way to hospital. Anyone can experience traumatic events, but you may be particularly likely to have experienced trauma if you: work in a high-risk occupation, such as the emergency services or armed forces. are a refugee or asylum seeker. were taken into foster care. Secondary trauma. If you experience symptoms of PTSD while supporting someone close to you who has experienced trauma, this is sometimes known as 'secondary trauma' or 'secondary traumatic stress'. 'Secondary' means that although the original (primary) trauma happened to someone else, the impact it's having in your life is traumatic for you. It doesn't mean it's any less significant than any other kind of PTSD, or any easier to deal with. Our page for friends and family has some tips on looking after yourself. Repeatedly witnessing or hearing about traumatic events in the course of your job is also sometimes called 'secondary trauma', although this experience is increasingly thought of by professionals as an original (primary) trauma."
"What is complex PTSD? Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD, sometimes abbreviated to c-PTSD or CPTSD) is a condition where you experience some symptoms of PTSD along with some additional symptoms, such as: difficulty controlling your emotions. feeling very angry or distrustful towards the world. constant feelings of emptiness or hopelessness. feeling as if you are permanently damaged or worthless. feeling as if you are completely different to other people. feeling like nobody can understand what happened to you. avoiding friendships and relationships, or finding them very difficult. often experiencing dissociative symptoms such as depersonalisation or derealisation. physical symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches. regular suicidal feelings. Other terms for complex PTSD. Complex PTSD is a fairly new term. Professionals have recognised for a while that some types of trauma can have additional effects to PTSD, but have disagreed about whether this is a form of PTSD or an entirely separate condition, and what it should be called. For example, you may find some doctors or therapists still use one of the following terms: enduring personality change after catastrophic experience (EPCACE). disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS) – this term is more common in America than the UK. At times I felt nothing was going to end the distress, experiencing more than 10 flashbacks a day... It was a long process of recovery, with lots of bumps along the road, but the right medication and long-term therapy with someone I came to trust, has changed my life. Complex PTSD and emotional flashbacks. If you have complex PTSD you may be particularly likely to experience what some people call an 'emotional flashback', in which you have intense feelings that you originally felt during the trauma, such as fear, shame, sadness or despair. You might react to events in the present as if they are causing these feelings, without realising that you are having a flashback. See our sections explaining what flashbacks are and tips for coping with flashbacks for more information. What causes complex PTSD? The types of traumatic events that can cause complex PTSD include: childhood abuse, neglect or abandonment. ongoing domestic violence or abuse. repeatedly witnessing violence or abuse. being forced or manipulated into prostitution (trading sex). torture, kidnapping or slavery. being a prisoner of war. You are more likely to develop complex PTSD if: you experienced trauma at an early age. the trauma lasted for a long time. escape or rescue were unlikely or impossible. you have experienced multiple traumas. you were harmed by someone close to you. Developing PTSD after experiencing domestic violence was not something I was prepared for. Physically I left my old home. Mentally I am still there. The prison is no longer that house – it is my mind. My thoughts. My memories. Misdiagnosis with BPD Some of the symptoms of complex PTSD are very similar to those of borderline personality disorder (BPD) , and not all professionals are aware of complex PTSD. As a result, some people are given a diagnosis of BPD or another personality disorder when complex PTSD fits their experiences more closely. Professionals disagree about when it's helpful to diagnose someone with a personality disorder or when another diagnosis or description is better. To find out more see our page on why personality disorders are controversial ? If you're worried that the diagnosis you've been given doesn't fit the way you feel, it's important to discuss it with a mental health professional so you can make sure you're getting the right treatment to help you.  Our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem provide information on how to make sure your voice is heard, and what you can do if you're not happy with your doctor. Coping with complex PTSD in the pandemic. My PTSD is rooted in the abuse I received as a teenager, and I have spent most of my adult life running away from it... I have suffered from anxiety and depression as a consequence. Read Clare's story What treatments are there? The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in health care – has not yet developed recommendations specifically for complex PTSD. They caution that the existing guidelines for PTSD weren't developed for this kind of diagnosis. You may find standard treatments for PTSD helpful, but many people with complex PTSD need more long-term, intensive support to recover. As part of your treatment y ou should also be offered support for other problems you experience, such as depression , drug and alcohol use or dissociation . The treatment you are offered may depend on what's available in your local area. See our treatment for PTSD page for more about the treatments available, which may be useful for complex PTSD. Or visit our page on self-care for PTSD for tips on how to look after yourself when you have complex PTSD. We also have a page for friends and family of someone with PTSD , with ideas on supporting someone who is struggling."
"How can I help myself? Living with PTSD can feel overwhelming. This page offers some practical suggestions for looking after yourself. Tips on coping with flashbacks. Flashbacks can be very distressing, but there are things you can do that might help. You could: Focus on your breathing. When you are frightened, you might stop breathing normally. This increases feelings of fear and panic, so it can help to concentrate on breathing slowly in and out while counting to five. Carry an object that reminds you of the present. Some people find it helpful to touch or look at a particular object during a flashback. This might be something you decide to carry in your pocket or bag, or something that you have with you anyway, such as a keyring or a piece of jewellery. Tell yourself that you are safe. It may help to tell yourself that the trauma is over and you are safe now. It can be hard to think in this way during a flashback, so it could help to write down or record some useful phrases at a time when you're feeling better. Comfort yourself. For example, you could curl up in a blanket, cuddle a pet, listen to soothing music or watch a favourite film. Keep a diary. Making a note of what happens when you have a flashback could help you spot patterns in what triggers these experiences for you. You might also learn to notice early signs that they are beginning to happen. Try grounding techniques. Grounding techniques can keep you connected to the present and help you cope with flashbacks or intrusive thoughts. For example, you could describe your surroundings out loud or count objects of a particular type or colour.  You can't stop the waves but you can learn to surf; through my PTSD recovery journey I've learnt that emotions come and go in waves. It's best not to fight against them but ride with them. Get to know your triggers add remove You might find that certain experiences, situations or people seem to trigger flashbacks or other symptoms. These might include specific reminders of past trauma, such as: smells. sounds. words. places. particular types of books or films. Some people find things especially difficult on significant dates, such as the anniversary of a traumatic experience. It can help to plan ahead for these times and use these self-care tips to help you. Confide in someone add remove When experiencing PTSD it can be hard to open up to others. This may be because you feel unable to talk about what has happened to you or because you find it difficult to trust others after your traumatic experience. You don't need to be able to describe the trauma to tell someone how you are currently feeling though. It could help to talk to a friend or family member, or a professional, such as a GP or a trained listener at a helpline.  Our page on talking to your GP also has tips on how to start difficult conversations about your feelings with your doctor. Give yourself time add remove Everyone has their own unique response to trauma and it's important to take things at your own pace. For example, it may not be helpful to talk about your experiences before you feel ready. Try to be patient with yourself and don't judge yourself harshly for needing time and support to recover from PTSD. Try peer support add remove Peer support brings together people who have had similar experiences, which some people find very helpful.  Hope. There is always hope. With the right treatment and support, things will get better. I'm a living testament. Find specialist support add remove You might find it useful to contact an organisation that specialises in advice and support for PTSD, such as ASSIST Trauma Care . It could also be helpful to find an organisation with expertise in the particular type of trauma you have experienced. See our useful contacts page for details of relevant organisations. Look after your physical health add remove Coping with PTSD can be exhausting. You might feel like you can't find the energy to take care of yourself, but looking after your physical health can make a difference to how you feel emotionally. For example, it can help to: Think about your diet. Drinking enough water, eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can help you cope when things feel difficult.  Try to exercise. Exercise can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing.  Spend time outside. The outside world might feel overwhelming, but spending time in green space can boost your wellbeing.  Avoid drugs and alcohol. While you might want to use drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, memories or physical pain, they can make you feel worse in the long run. They can also make other problems worse, such as difficulty sleeping.  PTSD and sleep problems Lots of people who experience PTSD have problems sleeping. You might: find it hard to fall or stay asleep. feel unsafe during the night. feel anxious or afraid of having nightmares.  Things that helped: I took up running, which helped me sleep, as it seemed to clear the excess adrenaline; talking to my friends and sisters, again and again; giving up sugar and alcohol, as I was using them as masks for my erratic behaviour. Homelessness and PTSD - how drumming helped me through. My determination to be a positive force in my children’s life was the reason I stayed and tried to work through my issues. Read Matt's story"
"What treatments are available? This page covers: talking treatments for PTSD. medication for PTSD. other treatment options. accessing treatment. Watchful waiting. If you have had PTSD symptoms for less than four weeks or they are relatively mild, your GP might suggest an approach called 'watchful waiting' before offering you any treatment. This involves monitoring your symptoms yourself to see if things improve. In this case you should be offered a follow-up appointment within one month. Talking treatments for PTSD. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in health care – currently recommends two types of talking treatment for PTSD: Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT). This is a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specifically adapted for PTSD. NICE recommends that you are offered 8–12 regular sessions of around 60–90 minutes, seeing the same therapist at least once a week.  Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). This is a fairly new treatment that can reduce PTSD symptoms such as being easily startled. It involves making rhythmic eye movements while recalling the traumatic event. The rapid eye movements are intended to create a similar effect to the way your brain processes memories and experiences while you're sleeping. EMDR Association UK - a professional association of EMDR clinicians and researchers - provides information about EMDR on its website. They also have a search function to find EMDR-accredited therapists in your area. NICE may recommend other talking treatments in future if they are found to help with PTSD, but more research is needed. One of the most disturbing things has been the feelings of aggression and anger towards anyone who looks like the person who attacked me... EMDR therapy has been massively helpful. What if I don't feel better? If the talking treatment you try doesn't seem to be helping, NICE suggests that you: tell your doctor or therapist you were expecting to feel differently. ask if you need more treatment, or a different type of treatment. Your doctor or therapist should offer you a second course of treatment or a follow-up appointment. You can read the full guidelines for PTSD treatment in English or Welsh on the NICE website. Medication for PTSD. People experiencing PTSD aren't routinely prescribed medication. However, you might be offered medication if: you also have depression. you have sleep problems caused by PTSD. you are unable or do not want to try talking treatments. If you are offered medication for PTSD, this will usually be an antidepressant. While PTSD is not the same as depression, this type of medication has been found to help. NICE recommends that doctors consider prescribing venlafaxine or a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline .  If you also experience symptoms of psychosis or severe hyperarousal (constantly feeling on high alert), and other medications have not helped you, you may be offered an antipsychotic to treat these symptoms. Antipsychotic treatment should be reviewed regularly by a specialist such as a psychiatrist.  Before you take any medication Before you decide to take any medication, you should make sure you have all the facts you need to feel confident about your decision. For guidance on what you might want to know about any drug before you take it, see our pages on: what you should know before taking any psychiatric drug. receiving the right medication for you. your right to refuse medication. Other treatment options. Some people with PTSD say they have found other treatments helpful in managing their condition, such as group therapy, arts therapies or dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) . Trauma can affect the body physically as well as psychologically and there is growing evidence to show that body-based therapy can help people experiencing PTSD to ground themselves and regulate emotions. You can find out more about body-based therapy and find a therapist via the Body Psychotherapy Network . However, the NICE guidelines recommend that treatments that have not been designed or properly tested for people who have experienced trauma should not be used on their own. If you're giving evidence in a criminal trial The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has published guidelines for vulnerable witnesses and victims of crime. This includes anyone giving evidence about rape or sexual assault. They advise that the most important factor when considering the option of having therapy as a victim or witness is your health and wellbeing. In the run up to the criminal trial, the police can request access to a victim’s therapy notes. The police can request this if they reasonably think that the notes might reveal material relevant to the investigation or the likely issues at trial. Accessing treatment. Here are some ways you could access treatment: Your GP. To get treatment on the NHS, you could visit your GP. For advice on preparing for a GP appointment, see our page on talking to your GP. Free NHS therapy services. You might be able to directly contact Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in your area, if you live in England. You can search for these on the NHS website. Specialist organisations. See our useful contacts page for organisations that may offer therapy or be able to put you in touch with local services. Local trauma services. Some organisations offer free or low-cost trauma therapy. Your local Mind on Mind's Infoline may have information about services in your area. Private therapists. Finding a private therapist is another option some people choose to explore. "
"How can friends and family help? This section is for friends or family who wish to support someone who has PTSD. It can be really hard to see someone you care about experiencing the symptoms of PTSD or complex PTSD. This page has some suggestions for ways you can support them while also looking after your own wellbeing. Listen to them. If you feel able to, you could help by: giving them time to talk at their own pace – it's important not to pressure them. allowing them to be upset about what has happened. not making assumptions about how they feel right now, or how they felt in the past. not dismissing their experiences by saying ""it could have been worse"" or questioning why they didn't say or do something differently. No one around me understood what I was going through. I found it hard to explain. Words just couldn't do justice to what I was going through. Try not to judge. If you've not experienced PTSD yourself, it can be hard to understand why your friend or family member can't seem to 'move on'. It's understandable to wish things could get back to normal, but it's important not to blame them or put pressure on them to get better without the time and support they need. Learn their triggers. Each person will have a different experience of PTSD, so it might help to talk about what sorts of situations or conversations might trigger flashbacks or difficult feelings. For example, they might be particularly distressed by loud noises, arguments or particular places. Understanding their triggers could help you to avoid these situations, and feel more prepared when flashbacks happen. Plan ahead for difficult times. When your friend or relative is feeling well, it can be helpful to discuss with them how you can help if they become unwell or if a crisis happens. You could: encourage them to write a crisis plan. discuss which symptoms you can look out for. get to know their triggers and plan how to cope with them. This can help them to avoid crises or manage them differently in future where possible. When having these conversations, make sure you also think about how much you can cope with and try to only offer support that you feel able to give. It is important to look after yourself too. For more information see our pages on planning for a crisis , helping someone else seek help and advocacy . Tips on helping someone who is experiencing a flashback Flashbacks are vivid experiences in which someone relives aspects of a traumatic event. It can be hard to know how to help during a flashback, but you don't need special training to support someone who is having one. It could help if you: try to stay calm. gently tell them that they are having a flashback. avoid making any sudden movements. encourage them to breathe slowly and deeply. encourage them to describe their surroundings. See our sections on what flashbacks are and tips for coping with flashbacks for more information. Respect their personal space. People who experience PTSD may often feel jumpy or on edge. They may be easily startled or feel they need to constantly watch out for danger. It can help if you: avoid crowding the person. don't touch or hug them without permission. try not to startle or surprise them. Look out for warning signs. You might see a change in the behaviour of the person you want to support. For example: a change in their mood, such as often feeling low, anxious, upset, angry or irritated. a change in performance at work, such as lateness or missing deadlines. a change in energy levels, such as extreme alertness or a lack of concentration. If you notice these sorts of changes in someone close to you, you could ask them how they are feeling. This might encourage them to open up. Help them to find support. If they want you to, you could help your friend or family member to find further support. For example you could: look through the list of relevant organisations in our page on useful contacts for PTSD. see our pages on supporting someone who is self-harming and supporting someone who feels suicidal if someone you care about is harming themselves or struggling with thoughts of suicide. Look after your own mental health. It's important to remember that your mental health matters too. Our pages on supporting someone else to seek help , how to cope when supporting someone else , managing stress and maintaining your wellbeing all have lots of information and tips on how to look after yourself. Support options for you A traumatic event can have a major impact not just on those who lived through it, but also on that person's close family, friends and colleagues. If you experience symptoms of PTSD yourself while supporting someone through a trauma (sometimes called secondary trauma ), it might help to try some of the tips on our self-care for PTSD page. It's also a good idea to talk to your GP about how you're feeling, and ask if they can offer you any treatment or support. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare - says professionals should consider the impact of traumatic events on relatives and think about how to provide appropriate care."

"What is PMDD? Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a very severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It causes a range of emotional and physical symptoms every month during the week or two before your period. It is sometimes referred to as 'severe PMS'. PMDD occurs during the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle. This is the time between when you ovulate and when your period starts. The luteal phase lasts approximately two weeks for most people but can be longer or shorter. During this time you may experience PMDD symptoms every day, or for a few days within the phase. The NHS website has more information on the stages of the menstrual cycle and when they occur. Many of us may experience symptoms of PMS. But if you have PMDD, these symptoms are much worse and can have a serious impact on your life. Experiencing PMDD can make it difficult to work, socialise and have healthy relationships. In some cases, it can also lead to suicidal thoughts. The best way to describe it is that, once a month, I pressed my own self-destruct button and literally let my (normally very happy and satisfying) life implode around me. Then when the dark thoughts lifted and cleared, I spent the next 2 weeks trying to pick up the pieces. What are the symptoms of PMDD? If you have PMDD, you might find that you experience some of symptoms listed below. But it's different for different people, so you might also experience other kinds of feelings which aren't listed here. Emotional experiences mood swings. feeling upset or tearful. lack of energy. less interest in activities you normally enjoy. feeling hopeless. suicidal feelings. feeling angry or irritable. feeling anxious. feeling tense or on edge. feeling overwhelmed or out of control. difficulty concentrating. Physical and behavioural experiences breast tenderness or swelling. pain in your muscles and joints. headaches. feeling bloated. changes in your appetite, such as overeating or having specific food cravings. sleep problems. increased anger or conflict with people around you. becoming very upset if you feel that others are rejecting you. As PMDD is linked to your menstrual cycle, you will likely not experience symptoms if you are pregnant. You may find that the symptoms return once you begin ovulating again though. In the depths of PMDD I tend to just retreat to my bed. I get very depressed and my anxiety goes sky high. I get hugely fatigued and can't keep my eyes open. I sleep for about 18 hours a day. PMDD and suicidal feelings Some people find that one of their monthly symptoms is thoughts about suicide. This can feel very distressing. If you're experiencing suicidal feelings and are worried you may act on them, you can call 999, go straight to A&E or call the Samaritans for free on 116 123 to talk. For more options see our pages on: ways to help yourself cope in a crisis. how to cope with suicidal feelings. What are the causes of PMDD? The exact causes are still not fully understood but researchers believe that PMDD is caused by being very sensitive to changes in hormone levels. Recent research suggests that PMDD is associated with increased sensitivity to the normal hormonal changes that occur during your monthly menstrual cycle. See the International Association for Premenstrual Disorders (IAPMD) website for further information on hormones and PMDD. There is research to suggest other possible causes for PMDD, as well as things that may make your PMDD worse. Some of these possible factors are: Genetics. Some research suggests that increased sensitivity to changes in hormone levels may be caused by genetic variations. Smoking. Some research suggests that smoking can have an impact on your hormone sensitivity. Trauma and stress. Other research has shown that in some cases PMDD may be linked to stressful and traumatic past events, such as emotional or physical abuse. Stress may also make your PMDD symptoms worse. Is PMDD a mental health problem? PMDD is commonly defined as an endocrine disorder, meaning that it is a hormone-related disorder. But as well as physical symptoms, people with PMDD also experience a range of different mental health symptoms such as depression , suicidal feelings and anxiety . For these reasons, it is listed as a mental health problem in the DSM-5, one of the main manuals that doctors use to categorise and diagnose mental health problems. Ultimately, it's important to remember that how you understand your symptoms and experiences is up to you. The most important thing is that you get the support you need and deserve to help you manage the effects of PMDD on your life. Every month for 30 years I barely managed to come through each month intact. PMDD is not merely bad PMS. It is so much more serious than that, and is absolutely life changing."
"How is PMDD diagnosed? To get a diagnosis of PMDD the best place to start is visiting your doctor. To help them understand your symptoms your doctor may: Ask you to keep a detailed record of your symptoms for at least two months, to see if your symptoms have a pattern over time. This may be in your diary or they may give you some daily questionnaires to fill out. Ask you about your medical history, such as any history of mental health problems. Ask about your lifestyle, such as if you smoke, drink alcohol or are overweight. Give you a physical examination along with some blood tests, so that they can rule out other medical problems. When you're asked to keep a record of your symptoms over several months, getting a diagnosis can feel like a very slow process. This can be frustrating if you're having to wait a long time to get treatment. Our page on self-care for PMDD has some ideas you can try in the meantime. I tracked my symptoms over three months, and saw that there was a direct correlation between my monthly cycle and my mental health. What if I'm struggling to get a diagnosis? Some people find getting a diagnosis of PMDD can be really difficult. This might be because it can take a long time to realise that your symptoms follow a cycle and that they are linked to your period. It can also be because PMDD is not very well known, even amongst health professionals. It can be really upsetting and frustrating if you feel like your doctor is overlooking something, or not taking you seriously. There are things you could try though: Keep your own detailed record of your symptoms over time. You could do this in a diary, or you can download mood charts from the internet. The more information you collect over a long period of time, the better prepared you'll be to explain your symptoms to you doctor. Take the PMDD treatment guidelines with you to your GP appointment. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome (NAPS) both provide detailed, step-by-step guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of PMS . These include severe PMS, which is another term for PMDD. You can download these from their websites. Ask at your GP surgery if you could speak to a doctor who specialises in mental health, gynaecology or endocrinology. Gynaecology is the branch of medicine that deals specifically with the female reproductive system, and endocrinology deals with hormones. Consider finding an advocate. An advocate is someone who can come to appointments with you and help make sure people listen to you.  PMDD and my lightbulb moment. I would say to anyone suffering with mental health issues, please do consider your monthly cycle as the possible cause of them. Talk to your doctor (and if they don’t listen, ask for a different doctor) and remember that there is help out there. Read Eleanor's story What if I'm trans or non-binary and think I might have PMDD? If you are trans or non-binary you can still get PMDD. If you are trans or non-binary, PMDD may increase feelings of discomfort with the gender you were assigned at birth. You may also find it difficult to talk to a GP, particularly if you have had a bad experience in the past. You have a right though to be listened to, respected and given the right support for you. For information on how doctors should address your health needs if you're trans or non-binary, see the General Medical Council (GMC)'s guidelines on trans healthcare . Remember that if you feel you've been treated unfairly by a healthcare professional, you can complain . If you think you might have PMDD and need support in finding trans or non-binary services to help you, see our pages on LGBTIQ+ mental health support . When the suicidal feelings became unbearable, I realised I had to take action. I decided I had to explain it properly to the doctor as my life depended on it, so I brought my mum with me and told the whole story. I got referred to a gynaecologist and now that I'm under hormonal treatment my symptoms are much better. Premenstrual exacerbation. Your doctor might consider whether you have premenstrual exacerbation (PME) rather than PMDD. This is when existing mental health problems are made worse during the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle. In PME, your symptoms will continue even after your period but at a lower intensity. This is why tracking your symptoms throughout your cycle is important so that you get the right diagnosis. The International Association for Premenstrual Disorders (IAPMD) has more information on PME on their website. Misdiagnosis with other mental health problems Sometimes people with PMDD can be wrongly diagnosed with other mental health problems such as depression or bipolar disorder . This is because they share some of the same symptoms. Also, if you have any other physical or mental health problems, experiencing PMDD at the same time can make the symptoms worse. For these reasons, it is really important to keep a clear and detailed record of how you're feeling over time, because with PMDD your symptoms will follow a regular monthly pattern. If you're worried that a diagnosis you've been given doesn't fit your experiences, it's important to discuss it with your doctor so you can make sure you're getting the right treatment to help you.  I saw five different (male) GPs before they accepted my suggestion that my problems were connected to my cycle and I eventually came away with a factsheet about 'PMS' in my hand. It wasn't until recently that I sat in front of a doctor who didn't look at me as if I was mad when I said that my menstrual cycle was driving me insane."
"How can I help myself? There are various things you can try to reduce the impact of PMDD on your life. Some people find these ideas useful, but remember that different things work for different people at different times. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. If something doesn't feel possible just now, try something else or come back to it another time. For example: Talk to someone you trust. Contact a specialist organisation. Try peer support. Get to know your cycle. Create a self-care box. Look after your emotional wellbeing. Look after your physical health. Talk to someone you trust. It may be that just having someone listen to you and show you they care can help in itself. Stay in touch. If you don't feel up to seeing people in person, or talking, send a text or email to keep in touch with friends and family. Keep talking. It might feel hard at first, but many people find that sharing their experiences can help them feel better. Unfortunately, some people feel uncomfortable discussing anything to do with reproductive health, as it's often considered to be something quite private, or even taboo, despite being a normal part of many people's everyday life. You may feel this way yourself. This can make it even more difficult for you to open up about physical and mental health problems related to your periods. But finding the words to tell others about what's going on is usually the first step you can take towards getting help and feeling better. If you are trans or non-binary, you may find that talking to someone about periods can bring up difficult feelings about the gender you were assigned at birth. Or you may worry that it will lead people to misgender you (call you by a term that does not match your gender identity). You may find it difficult to talk about it with even close friends. How you feel about your period and how you cope with these feelings will be unique to you. We have a list of LGBTIQ+ organisations you can reach out to if you want to speak to someone who understands your experience. Contact a specialist organisation. You might find it useful to contact an organisation that specialises in support and advice for PMDD. Whilst there is not a specific organisation for PMDD support in the UK, you may find it useful to visit the International Association for Premenstrual Disorders (IAPMD) , which is an American organisation. The National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome (NAPS) may also be useful. These organisations may be able to direct you to more sources of support. Try peer support. Peer support brings together people who have had similar experiences, which some people find very helpful. The International Association for Premenstrual Disorders (IAPMD) provides more information about online peer support available for people with PMDD around the world, including links to various online groups you could join if you choose to have a Facebook account. Mind's Side by Side community is a supportive online space which welcomes people with experience of all kinds of mental health problems.  If you feel unsure about the idea of talking to people over the internet, you might find it useful to read our pages on how to stay safe online . I have suffered with PMDD for 20 years but only been diagnosed for 18 months. It can be a very lonely experience and support via peer support groups has been invaluable for me. Not only just to know that I wasn't the only one going through it but to learn information about treatments. Get to know your cycle. If your symptoms follow a pattern, you may be able to work out when you are most likely to start to experience these symptoms in the future. For example, if you notice that over the past three months your symptoms have started seven days before your period, you could try and work out when this would be for the upcoming months. Being able to predict when your symptoms may start may help you to put things in place for that time. For example you could: rearrange stressful events and tasks for another time. plan relaxing activities that you know improve your mood. put in place a support plan that sets out how you would like to be supported in a particular situation. create a self-care box. If you have a smartphone, you may find it useful to use period tracking apps if you have an unpredictable cycle. There are a range of apps available with a variety of functions, so you can research which one works best for you. I know my PMDD cycle like the back of my hand now and plan my days/weeks/month accordingly. On the days I know I'll be bad I never plan anything important. I try and be positive about these days. I record TV programmes and watch them in bed. I save books and magazines to read and have meditation apps. I make sure I have the right foods in the house and meals that need just popping in the microwave. Create a self-care box. It can be really difficult to come up with ideas to help you feel better when you're feeling low. So you might find it useful to create a self-care box in advance, that you can use whenever you need to. A self-care box is filled with things that normally cheer you up and help you relax. For example, you could include your favourite book or film, a notebook and pen to write down your thoughts, or some notes of encouragement to yourself. Look after your emotional wellbeing. Manage stress. It can help to think of ways to manage pressure and build your emotional resilience.  Try some relaxation techniques. Learning to relax can help you look after your wellbeing when you are feeling stressed, anxious or busy.  Spend time in nature. Being outside in green space can help you feel more in touch with your surroundings.  Try mindfulness. Practising mindfulness could help you manage unwanted thoughts and reduce stress.  I made a decision that I was going to accept I have PMDD and make positive lifestyle changes to try and live as happily and stress-free as I could. It took a few years and was not an easy process. Now I work part-time nannying, but on my terms. A complete turnaround from my previous jobs. If I focused on the negative of these choices I might say it's not the life I had planned for myself, but I try not to dwell on this. Look after your physical health. Try to get enough sleep. Sleep can give you the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences.  Think about your diet. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels.  Try and take some exercise. If you are experiencing physical symptoms you may find it difficult to exercise, but research has shown that exercise can help reduce symptoms of depression. You may also find that it might help you to relax.  My diet has changed loads. I gave up red meat and try to eat no sugar and drink hardly any alcohol. I exercise when I can and find meditation and yoga really helpful. Reasonable adjustments If your PMDD affects your ability to work, study or access services, consider asking for reasonable adjustments. One of the criteria for a PMDD diagnosis is that it has a significant impact on your work, social, education or family life. Some people with PMDD find that it is difficult to work, interact with people, take part in education or complete essential tasks during times when their PMDD symptoms are at their worst. If you feel your PMDD is impacting your ability to work, take part in education, or get services when you need them, you may be able to ask for reasonable adjustments. You can see our pages on the Equality Act 2010 and asking for reasonable adjustments for more information on what you may be able to ask for."
"What are the treatments? There are a number of different treatments for PMDD that have been found to work for some people. You and your doctor should decide your treatment together. The decision should be based on how bad your PMDD symptoms are, your personal preferences, and if you have any plans to become pregnant. This page covers: SSRIs. Combined oral contraceptives. Talking therapy and counselling. Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs. GnRH analogue injections. Surgery. If you are trans or non-binary, your treatment options may differ if you are taking or considering taking hormone treatments. You can speak to your GP or specialist to explore what treatment would work best for you. You can see our pages on specialist organisations supporting LGBTQIA+ mental health if you are unsure of where to start. It took me two years to realise that my symptoms were cyclical. My best friend made the connection. It's then taken another three years to get to a treatment that works. Looking back it seems like such a long haul, and I'm glad I'm this end of it for now. Making healthy lifestyle changes When you first talk to your doctor, they may suggest some lifestyle changes which could improve your physical and mental health. This may reduce your PMDD symptoms to a manageable level without the need for further treatment. Or it may be something you try alongside another treatment. Possible suggestions they might make are: getting more regular exercise. changes in your diet. getting regular sleep. trying to reduce your stress levels. reducing the amount of alcohol you drink. if you smoke, trying to cut down or stop entirely. reducing the amount of caffeine in your diet. This will be different for everyone, as the changes you feel able to make will depend on your personal circumstances and experiences. SSRIs. SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) are a type of antidepressant. They are often the first recommended treatment for PMDD and are the only type of antidepressant which has been shown to work for PMDD. Some studies have suggested that SSRIs may work differently for PMDD symptoms than they do for mental health problems such as depression. Your doctor may recommend you take SSRIs daily throughout the whole month or just during your luteal phase . It is normally recommended that you do not start and stop taking SSRIs suddenly, but studies have shown that for some people with PMDD taking SSRIs during just the luteal phase can be effective and withdrawal symptoms are not as intense. If your doctor prescribes you SSRIs, they should review them with you after two months to make sure they are working for you. If they aren't, your doctor may suggest a different treatment or an adjustment to the antidepressants.  Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.  My periods became overwhelming when my dad died. Whilst I will most likely always struggle before my period, it has got easier. The weeks before my period are now manageable. Read Carla's story Combined oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives (often just called 'the pill') may reduce the symptoms of PMDD by controlling or stopping your periods, but the evidence for the pill as a treatment for PMDD is mixed. Some people do find it helps to reduce their symptoms, but others find it makes their symptoms worse. The pill can also cause side effects and is not appropriate if you are trying to get pregnant. Oral contraceptives come in different types with different mixes of hormones. It may mean that certain hormone combinations won't work well for you. As PMDD occurs during your ovulation, pills that prevent ovulation may be more successful in managing your PMDD symptoms. If you and your doctor do think this medication might help, it is likely that you will be given a three-month trial to see if the treatment is right for you. You can find more information about combined oral contraceptives on the NHS website . Talking therapy and counselling. To help manage the psychological symptoms you experience you may want to consider seeing a therapist for talking treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown to be effective for some people with PMDD in managing their symptoms. Your doctor may refer you to an NHS talking therapies service (previously known as IAPT). These services treat various mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression . However, they aren't available in all areas and the waiting lists can be long. You can find out whether services are available near you through the NHS talking therapies webpage . In some cases you might be able to self-refer to see a therapist.  Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs. Your doctor may suggest you take painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs (for example ibuprofen) to help you manage the physical symptoms of PMDD such as headaches, joint and muscle pains. Although you may be able to get these without a prescription from your doctor, it's a good idea to discuss it with your doctor or pharmacist first to make sure that they're suitable for you. GnRH analogue injections. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues can be helpful for some people, as they reduce the symptoms of PMDD by bringing on a temporary menopause. They typically come as injections. This treatment should only be considered if no other treatments have been effective though. They can cause side effects such as loss of bone density, which puts you at higher risk of developing osteoporosis (a condition in which your bones become weak and break more easily). Because of this, treatment is often limited to six months, and should be combined with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which relieves symptoms of the menopause and reduces bone density loss. If you're prescribed GnRH analogues as a long-term treatment your doctor should give you an annual check-up to measure your bone mineral density. My symptoms took almost three months to settle down [after starting hormonal treatment] but now I am able to go to work every day and only have 1-2 bad days a month, which is much more manageable. Surgery. In very severe cases your doctor may talk to you about the possibility of a total hysterectomy (an operation to remove your uterus) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (an operation to remove your ovaries and fallopian tubes). The aim of this surgery is to get rid of your PMDD symptoms by permanently stopping your monthly cycle. Some people may be offered a bilateral oophorectomy alone (to remove just the ovaries and fallopian tubes). However, this may mean having to take progesterone (a hormone produced during the second half of the menstrual cycle) afterwards as part of your hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which may mean you continue to experience symptoms similar to PMS. More information on HRT can be found on the You and Your Hormones website . All surgery carries a risk of complications – and this surgery is non-reversible – so this would only be something you and your doctor would consider when you've already tried every other possible treatment and nothing has worked. The surgery would not be appropriate if you are wanting to get pregnant. Vitamins and supplements There is some limited evidence that certain supplements may reduce premenstrual symptoms. Some examples are: Calcium carbonate – some research indicates that this may help to reduce the physical and psychological symptoms. Vitamin B 6 – this may help to relieve symptoms, but if you take too much it may lead to a condition called peripheral neuropathy which is a condition where you lose feeling in your arms and legs. Agnus castus (a herb known as chasteberry) – some research has shown that this may help reduce symptoms of irritability, anger, headaches and breast pain. It is not recommended for use if you are trying to get pregnant or are breastfeeding. However, these are not officially recommended as treatments as there is not enough strong evidence that they can treat PMDD specifically. If you are considering taking a supplement it's important to speak to your doctor or local pharmacist first, as taking them alongside other medications or in the wrong dose could be dangerous."
"How can other people help? This information is for friends and family who want to support someone with PMDD. If you are supporting a friend or relative who is experiencing PMDD it can sometimes be hard to know what you can do to help. This page lists some things you could try. Take it seriously. Some people with PMDD find it hard to explain what they're going through, and it's particularly difficult when others dismiss their experiences as ""just that time of the month"" or ""just something all women experience"". These misconceptions are not true, but it can make it very hard for anyone who experiences PMDD to open up about how they're feeling. It is important to understand that PMDD can have a large effect on someone's life. The symptoms are very real, and can be very difficult to cope with. I still can't bring myself to tell a lot of friends and colleagues what has gone on, due to the pervading attitude of 'women's problems / it's just your period'. Try to understand. Find out as much as you can about PMDD. This will help you understand what they are going through. Reading about people's personal experiences in blogs can help too. See our useful contacts page for places you can go to find out more. Ask them about their personal experience of living with PMDD. You could ask them how PMDD affects their life and what things can make it better or worse. Listening to their experience might help you to understand how they feel. My relationships with friends and family have suffered too. I have a terrible relationship with my sister because she just refuses to understand or acknowledge my PMDD. I'm fortunate my parents are as understanding as they can be, but for a non-PMDD sufferer PMDD is really difficult to understand. Ask them what helps. PMDD can affect people in different ways, so it's important to ask what things they would find most helpful. They may just want your emotional support or there may be specific practical things you could do that could help them cope. For example, they may find it helps if you offer to take some of the pressure off them by helping out with daily tasks such as household chores or food shopping. Be patient. Even with support, someone with PMDD may be irritable at times and act differently than they normally do. It can be hard to support someone if they do not appear to appreciate the help you are trying to offer. It's not easy, but you may find that you need to be a bit more patient than usual. Remember that this won't last forever and their symptoms should get better within a few days. When they experience their symptoms, they might say or do things that upset you. If this happens, it can be helpful to try to wait until after the symptoms have passed before bringing it up so that they may feel more able to cope with talking about it. Reassure them. When they experience symptoms, you can try to reassure them that the symptoms will soon pass, that you are there to support them and that they are not on their own. Often just knowing that there is someone around who understands helps a lot. Some people with PMDD experience suicidal feelings . This can be difficult to cope with, for both of you.  My partner is very supportive and that helps so much and really does mean the world to me. He makes my world feel very safe when I feel very lost. Plan around their monthly cycle. PMDD symptoms happen at specific times in the menstrual cycle . If you can predict when the symptoms are likely to start, you may want to plan things in advance that might help. For example, you could schedule time to help out with daily chores, plan activities that may help them to relax or just make sure that people will be around to offer their support. It might also help to avoid planning any activities during that time that they might find difficult. Support them to seek help. Supporting your friend or loved one to seek help can be really important. It can help to remind them that PMDD is a recognised condition like many others, and that they deserve treatment and support. You can read our information on treatments for PMDD and self-care , and encourage them to seek help from their GP.  Not all healthcare professionals are aware of PMDD or fully understand it, so people can sometimes face barriers to getting the treatment and support they deserve. Knowing that you're in their corner to support them could help them keep trying if they do face barriers. You could even consider becoming their advocate.  Look after yourself. It can sometimes be really challenging to support someone, and it's common to feel overwhelmed at times. It's important to remember to look after your own mental health too, so you have the energy, time and distance you need to be able to help your friend or family member. For example: Set boundaries and don't take too much on. If you become unwell yourself you won't be able to offer as much support. It is also important to decide what your limits are and how much you are able to help them.  Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone. Talk to others about how you're feeling. You may want to be careful about how much information you share about the person you're supporting, but talking about your own feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too. "

"What is psychosis? Psychosis (also called a 'psychotic experience' or 'psychotic episode') is when you perceive or interpret reality in a very different way from people around you. You might be said to 'lose touch' with reality. The most common types of psychotic experiences are hallucinations , delusions and disorganised thinking and speech . For more information on these see our page on types of psychosis . Psychosis affects people in different ways. You might experience it once, have short episodes throughout your life, or live with it most of the time. Some people have positive experiences of psychosis. For example, if you see the faces of loved ones or hear their voices you may find this comforting. Some people say it helps them understand the world or makes them more creative. Twelve years on, I can reflect upon my experience as a transformative one. However, for other people psychosis can be a very difficult or frightening experience. You may find that it: affects your behaviour or disrupts your life. makes you feel very tired or overwhelmed. makes you feel anxious, scared, threatened or confused. leaves you finding it very difficult to trust some organisations or people. It can also be upsetting if people around you dismiss your experiences as untrue when they seem very real to you. You may feel misunderstood and frustrated if other people don't understand. It might help to share our section for friends and family with them. The sense of shame and guilt I felt because was I incapable of functioning day-to-day as an adult left me isolated from others and aggressive to those who cared and wanted to help. Is psychosis a diagnosis or a symptom? The word psychosis is usually used to refer to an experience. It is a symptom of certain mental health problems rather than a diagnosis itself. Doctors and psychiatrists may describe someone as experiencing psychosis rather than giving them a specific diagnosis. Some people prefer this. If you are diagnosed with one or more of these conditions then you may experience psychosis. Alternatively, if you experience psychosis (and you have other symptoms too), then you may be given one of these diagnoses: severe depression. schizophrenia. bipolar disorder. schizoaffective disorder. paranoid personality disorder or schizotypal personality disorder. postpartum psychosis. delusional disorder. Some people experience psychosis on its own. If you experience psychosis for less than a month and your doctor doesn't think that another diagnosis describes your symptoms better, you may receive the diagnosis of 'brief psychotic disorder'. See our types of psychosis and causes of psychosis pages for more information. Psychosis and stigma. There are a lot of misunderstandings about what it means to experience psychosis. Lots of people wrongly think that the word 'psychotic' means 'dangerous'. The media often shows people with psychosis behaving like this even though very few people who experience psychosis ever hurt anyone else. It's important to remember that you aren't alone and you don't have to put up with people treating you badly. For some suggestions on things you can do to tackle stigma have a look at our information page on stigma and misconceptions . My experience of psychosis. It was an extremely difficult time of my life, not only for me but also for those around me. Read Louise's story"
"What types of psychosis are there? This page covers: hallucinations. delusions. disorganised thinking and speech. Hallucinations. Hallucinations could include: seeing things that other people don't (for example people's faces, animals or religious figures). seeing objects that seem to be distorted or move in ways that they usually wouldn't. experiencing tastes, smells and sensations that have no apparent cause (for example feeling insects crawling on your skin). hearing voices that other people don't (these could be positive and helpful or hostile and nasty). I felt as though I was in wonderland. None of my family or friends understood why... I had a calling from a voice in sky. I was lost and lonely. Delusions. Lots of people have beliefs that many other people don't share. But a delusion is usually a belief that nobody else shares and which other experiences or perceptions show cannot be true. It is natural for delusions to feel completely real to you when you are experiencing them. You might think that you are a very important person. For example, you may believe that you are rich and powerful or that you can control the stock markets or the weather. These kinds of beliefs are sometimes called 'delusions of grandeur' . Some people find that they can spend a lot of money or take on a lot of debt while they are experiencing psychosis, because their sense of reality has been affected.  Some delusions can be very frightening and can make you feel threatened or unsafe. For example, you might feel that something or someone is trying to control, harm or kill you (even when you have no reason to believe this). These ideas are sometimes called paranoid delusions. Disorganised thinking and speech. Hallucinations and delusions can make your thoughts and emotions feel confused and disorganised, but disorganised thinking (sometimes called 'formal thought disorder') can also be a specific type of psychosis. Mental health professionals may use the following terms to describe what you are experiencing: Racing thoughts is when your thoughts go through your head very fast. It can involve them racing so fast that they feel out of control. Flight of ideas is where your thoughts move very quickly from idea to idea, making links and seeing meaning between things that other people don't. Many people find that they experience racing thoughts and flight of ideas at the same time. If you have disorganised thinking you might: speak very quickly and stumble over your words so that other people may find it difficult to understand what you're saying. link words together because of the way they sound rather than what they mean, which can make your speech sound jumbled to other people (this is sometimes called word salad). change the topic of conversation very quickly as your thoughts move from one thing to another. find it difficult to keep your attention on one thing. Racing ideas flooded my mind. It seemed as though my mind was disintegrating, my inner life – my unconscious mind – started flooding my consciousness without a break. You may also have racing thoughts and flight of ideas if you experience mania or hypomania . If you only experience them during a depressive, manic or mixed episode then you may be given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. "
"What causes psychosis? The cause of psychosis can be different for everyone, and research into it is happening all the time. Psychosis could be triggered by a number of things, such as: Physical illness or injury. You may see or hear things if you have a high fever, head injury, or lead or mercury poisoning. If you have Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease you may also experience hallucinations or delusions. Abuse or trauma. If you have experienced abuse or a traumatic event, you are more likely to experience psychosis. This includes experiences of racism. Recreational drugs. Researchers still aren't sure whether using recreational drugs directly causes psychosis but you may be more likely to hear or see things as a result of taking certain recreational drugs, like cannabis and LSD. If you have already experienced psychosis, using recreational drugs can make the symptoms worse, in particular if you take high-potency cannabis ('skunk'). Alcohol and smoking. Drinking alcohol and smoking may also stop medication from effectively treating your symptoms, making relapse more likely. Prescribed medication. You might also experience psychosis as a side effect of some prescribed drugs or while you are coming off psychiatric drugs. It's an illness that can be treated just like any other. I don't choose or want to be psychotic any more than people choose or want any other types of ill health. Hunger. You may experience hallucinations if you are very hungry, have low blood sugar or if you are not getting enough food. Lack of sleep. You may experience hallucinations if you have a severe lack of sleep. Bereavement. If you have recently been bereaved, you may hear them talking to you. You may also feel that they are with you even though you can't see them. Spiritual experiences. Some people experience voices or visions as part of a spiritual experience. This may be a positive experience for you. It may make you feel special or important and help you make sense of your life. It could however also be a negative experience – for example, you may feel that you're possessed by an evil spirit. Genetic inheritance. You are more likely to develop psychosis if you have a parent or sibling who has experienced psychosis, but researchers aren't sure why this happens."

Sleep can help give you the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences.  Think about your diet. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels.  Try to do some physical activity. Exercise can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing.  Spend time outside. Spending time in green space can boost your wellbeing.  Avoid drugs and alcohol. While you might want to use drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, in the long run they can make you feel a lot worse and can prevent you from dealing with any underlying problems that the drug or alcohol use may have been masking.  I think a routine of structure, quiet and an unpressurised environment, combined with medication, was ultimately the key to my recovery. Create a crisis plan add remove During a crisis you may not be able to tell people what helps you. When you are feeling well it can be a good idea to talk to someone you trust about what you would like to happen (or not to happen) when you are in crisis. It might help to create a crisis plan.

"What treatments are there for psychosis? For many people, there is no quick and simple treatment for psychosis, but with the right support it is possible to manage the symptoms of psychosis and recover. This does not mean that the experience of psychosis will go away entirely. You may find that you still experience symptoms during and after treatment. What treatment can do though is help you learn ways of coping so that your experiences are less distressing and don't interfere with your life as much. How do doctors decide my treatment? Before you start any treatment, your mental health professionals should discuss all your options with you and listen to what you want. They should look at all aspects of your life including your environment, culture and ethnicity, and any possible physical causes of your psychosis. Your treatment may depend on whether you are diagnosed with a specific mental health problem. It may be that psychosis is one of several symptoms you're experiencing, which will influence what treatment you are offered. An advocate can help you get the treatment you need.  What treatment is available? Talking therapies can help you understand your experiences and develop coping strategies to deal with them. You may be offered 'cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis' (sometimes called CBTp). This is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specifically for people experiencing psychosis. Antipsychotic medication is offered to most people with psychosis, as a way of managing symptoms. You may also be offered other drugs (for example antidepressants or mood stabilisers) if you experience mood based symptoms, as well as additional medication to help reduce the side effects caused by the antipsychotics. Arts therapies can help you express how you are feeling in different ways. They can be helpful if you are having difficulty talking about your experience. Family intervention focuses on helping family members talk to each other about what helps, solve problems and plan for a crisis. Your GP will be able to find out if this is available in your area. My antipsychotic medication saved my life. It took many tries to get the right medication for me. What other support can I get? Early intervention (EI) teams Early intervention (EI) teams work with you during your first experience of psychosis. They usually include people who can help you in different ways. For example: psychiatrists. psychologists. community mental health nurses. social workers. support workers. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that early intervention services should be open to people of all ages. But some places only offer services to people under a certain age – usually under 35. Rethink mental illness has more information about mental health teams including early intervention teams . Community care If you experience psychosis a lot or it lasts a long time, you may be referred to community care services to help you cope. The phrase 'community care' is used to describe the various services available to help you manage your physical and mental health problems in the community. This might include: your community mental health team (CMHT). nursing or social work support. home help. day centres. supported accommodation. Community care can also include crisis services and early intervention teams. If you become very distressed during an episode of psychosis you may need to be cared for in hospital.  A stay in intensive care saved my life, followed by three months on a psychiatric ward."
"How can friends and family help? This section is for friends and family who would like to support someone they know who experiences psychosis. You can help by lending an ear to talk to, especially between visits from mental health professionals. It can be really hard to see someone you care about experiencing psychosis. But there are some things you can do to try and help. This page has some suggestions for ways you can support them while also looking after your own wellbeing. Listen and try to understand. It can help if your loved one feels able to discuss their feelings and options with someone supportive and calm. Listen to their experiences and ask them what would help. Our information can help you understand more about psychosis. Focus on feelings rather than experiences. It's hard to know how to respond when someone sees, hears or believes something that you don't. Instead of confirming or denying their experience it can help to say something like ""I understand that you see things that way, but it's not like that for me"". It's usually more helpful to focus on how the person is feeling about what they are experiencing. Offer practical help. Ask them if they would like any practical help. For example they may like your help to access a particular service or ask you to act as an advocate for them. The extremes of behaviour and emotions played havoc with my relationships and daily functioning, to the point where the simplest of tasks overwhelmed me. Respect their wishes. Even if you feel that you know what's best, it's important to respect their wishes and don't try and take over or make decisions without them. People tend to do less well if family and friends are very critical or over-protective. Family intervention. Family intervention can help the whole family understand what the person with psychosis is going through and identify what is helpful and unhelpful for them and for you. You might want to ask your GP if this is available in your area. Plan for a crisis. When your loved one is feeling well you may want to discuss and plan how you can help them in a crisis. This could include planning practical things like treatment and hospital visits. You might also find it helpful to state clearly what you feel you can and can't support them with during a crisis. Get support for yourself. Seeing someone you care about experiencing psychosis can be distressing or frightening. Our information on how to cope when supporting someone else and how to improve your mental wellbeing can help you look after yourself too. Help in an emergency. If you are worried that your family member or friend is becoming very unwell or experiencing a mental health crisis you could suggest that they use their crisis plan (if they have one).

"What is schizoaffective disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is a mental health problem where you experience psychosis as well as mood symptoms. The word schizoaffective has two parts: ‘Schizo–‘ refers to symptoms of psychosis. ‘–Affective’ refers to mood symptoms. Some people have suggested that schizoaffective disorder sits in the middle of a spectrum, with schizophrenia at one end and bipolar disorder at the other. This is because these diagnoses share many similar symptoms. But schizoaffective disorder is recognised as a separate diagnosis. You might have times when you struggle to look after yourself. Or when your doctors feel that you lack insight into your behaviour and how you're feeling. Symptoms can begin at any age, but usually start when you’re a young adult. Some people only experience symptoms of schizoaffective disorder once in their life. Schizoaffective disorder and Me. Things started having secret meanings and I was convinced I could see into the future. Read Charlotte's story Schizoaffective disorder and stigma. Some people may not understand or have heard of schizoaffective disorder. They may have misconceptions about you. Or a negative or inaccurate image of schizoaffective disorder. This can feel very upsetting. Especially if the person who thinks this way is a friend, colleague, family member or healthcare professional. Schizoaffective disorder is less well known than some other mental health problems. This may make it harder to find information or support. Or to connect with others who have similar experiences. This may feel frustrating and lonely at times. You might want to think about the following options: Show people this information. It might help them understand what your diagnosis means. Get more involved in your treatment. You can make your voice heard. You can also take steps if you’re not happy with your care.

"What are the symptoms of schizoaffective disorder? This page has information about the different symptoms and types of schizoaffective disorder. It covers: Symptoms of psychosis. Mood symptoms. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Diagnosing schizoaffective disorder. Symptoms of psychosis. These symptoms are similar to those experienced in schizophrenia, including: Hallucinations - where you may experience things that others around you don't. For example hearing voices, seeing visual hallucinations and other unexplained sensations. Delusions - where you might hold strong beliefs that nobody else shares. For example, a fear that everyone can hear your thoughts or that you can control the weather. You may also experience: Your thoughts becoming very disorientated. Feeling confused or frightened. Feeling disconnected from your emotions. Difficulty concentrating. A lack of motivation or interest in things. These feelings can be managed with the right combination of treatment, support and self-care. For more information, see our page on psychosis. You could also visit Intervoice or The Hearing Voices Network . One of the peculiar thoughts I experienced was that I was being headhunted by a company for a job, which definitely never happened, it was just an idea in my head that I had convinced myself was true. Mood symptoms. The mood symptoms of schizoaffective disorder are similar to those experienced in bipolar disorder. They can include both manic and depressive symptoms: Manic symptoms - you may feel extremely excited or irritated. Or make unrealistic plans and behave in ways that might put you at risk. Depressive symptoms - you may feel sad and low or experience sleep problems. You may also feel disconnected from others or experience suicidal feelings. The periods of time where you experience mood symptoms are sometimes called 'episodes'. You may experience depressive episodes, manic episodes, or both. You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis. But schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can involve similar symptoms and experiences. Diagnosing schizoaffective disorder can be complex. Not all professionals agree on how best to diagnose or describe it. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be considered if you’ve experienced: Symptoms that have lasted for a month or longer. Symptoms of psychosis and mood symptoms at the same time. Mood symptoms for most of the time that you've felt unwell. A period of time (usually at least 2 weeks) of symptoms of psychosis without mood symptoms. Depressive episodes that include low mood. Schizoaffective disorder is often seen as a psychotic disorder with significant mood features, rather than a mood disorder with psychosis. My problems were not picked up as a teenager, which resulted in a crisis in my early 20 s, involving hospital admissions and being severely mentally unwell. The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder seemed to fit with my experience better than any other 'label' or diagnosis. Diagnosing schizoaffective disorder. To diagnose schizoaffective disorder, a psychiatrist will assess your symptoms and ask how long you've had them. They'll consider how psychosis and mood symptoms happen for you (either together or separately) during episodes. They'll also consider how your symptoms affect your daily life or relationships. The psychiatrist may check for any physical problems that could be causing your symptoms. Recreational drugs can also cause similar symptoms. So it might be useful for your psychiatrist to know if you are using any (or have done in the past). Differences between diagnoses are subtle. You may be given different diagnoses by different psychiatrists. It may feel frustrating if your diagnosis changes. You may feel like you've got used to one diagnosis, and now you need to get used to a new one. Or you may feel relieved and that the new diagnosis is a better fit for you. You may feel like you don't need any diagnosis at all. There’s no right or wrong way to feel about this. At first I was diagnosed with depression, postpartum psychosis, and then finally schizoaffective disorder. I had to do a lot of research myself to understand what I was going through better, which was difficult. What can I do if I disagree with my diagnosis? If your diagnosis doesn't fit with the way you feel, it's important to discuss this with a mental health professional. This is to make sure you're getting the right treatment to help you.  And what you can do if you're not happy with your doctor."
"What causes schizoaffective disorder? Researchers don't know exactly what causes schizoaffective disorder. But it's likely to be caused by a combination of factors, such as: Stressful or traumatic life events. Childhood trauma. Brain chemistry. Genetics. Stressful or traumatic life events. Some people find that stressful or traumatic experiences can trigger a mood episode or an episode of psychosis. Stress may also make your symptoms feel more intense or difficult to manage. You may be able to link the start of your symptoms to a very stressful period in your life, such as: Abuse or neglect. Experiencing a traumatic loss. Being out of work. Being bullied or harassed, including racism. Feeling lonely or isolated. Relationship problems or break-ups. Losing someone close to you. Having housing problems or becoming homeless. Having money problems.  Childhood trauma. Some evidence suggests that experiencing a great deal of emotional distress as a child may increase the risk of developing schizoaffective disorder. This can include experiences like: Sexual or physical abuse. Neglect. Traumatic events. Losing someone very close to you, such as a parent or carer. Experiencing trauma and distress as a child can have a lasting effect. For example, on how you’re able to regulate your emotions as an adult.  Brain chemistry. The way mental health problems and brain chemistry are related is still unclear and debated. The human brain is extremely complex. And the research and arguments in this area are complicated. Schizoaffective disorder symptoms can sometimes be helped by taking certain psychiatric medications. Some of these medications are thought to act on your neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that communicate information throughout your brain and body. Some research suggests that schizoaffective disorder may relate to problems with how these neurotransmitters work, but no one knows for sure. Genetics. If you experience schizoaffective disorder, you're more likely to have a family member who also experiences symptoms of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (even if they don’t have a diagnosis). However, research into genetic causes is limited. Research hasn't found a single gene that's responsible for schizoaffective disorder. Family links are more complex. Researchers think that environmental factors may explain why some people experience symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . And family members can be a very influential part of your environment as you grow up. We don’t know why someone might develop schizoaffective symptoms rather than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. I have a long family history of mental health problems, my Dad and his twin had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and my Mum and her Mum had a diagnosis of bipolar."
"Self-care for schizoaffective disorder. Many people who are diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder are able to live happy and fulfilling lives. Self-care can help with this. Self-care is how you look after your daily routine and the things that affect how you're feeling. For example, exercise, relationships and diet. What helps you may be different from someone else. It’s worth trying out different things until you find what works for you. You may find that making small changes in certain areas can help prevent some problems from developing. It can help to: Think about your triggers. Create a crisis plan. Try peer support. Try calling a helpline. Try new ways of relaxing. Other activities. Think about your diet. Try some physical activity. Visit a recovery college. Think about your triggers. You might find it helpful to keep track of your experiences over a period of time. You could try doing this for a few weeks at first, noting things down in a diary or on your phone. It may be helpful to track: Your moods and symptoms. Everyday events. Sleep quality. Your diet. Doing this may help you to spot patterns in your thoughts, feelings and behaviours. It may also help you to think about situations that you find difficult, as well as those which have been helpful. There are many online mood diaries which you may find helpful. Bipolar UK has a mood scale , mood diary and mood tracker app , which are free to use. You might want to share your observations with your close family, friends or care team. It may be helpful for them to listen to you when you're having a bad day. Or to help you keep on top of your commitments and be aware of your triggers. Having thoughts on paper makes it easier to give them structure and find answers. Create a crisis plan. During a crisis, you may not always be able to tell people what helps you. While you’re feeling well, it may be a good idea to talk to someone you trust about what you'd like to happen if you're in a crisis.  Try peer support. You might find it very helpful to talk to other people who have similar experiences to you. Peer support can be a great way to do this. Peer support can help you: Feel more positive about the future. Increase your self-esteem. Find friends. Recognise patterns in your experiences. Develop and discuss ways of coping. Identify early signs of crisis. Various organisations run groups or programmes. The Hearing Voices Network hosts groups across the country for people who hear, see or sense things that others don't. There are lots of ways to find peer support: See our list of useful contacts. See our peer support directory. Ask your local Mind about peer support. Try an online peer support community like Mind's Side by Side. Try calling a helpline. If you need to talk to someone but don't feel ready to try peer support, there are helplines you can call when you're feeling distressed. For example, Samaritans or SANEline . Talking to a trained listener could help you feel supported and make sense of what's happening for you. Try new ways of relaxing. It may be helpful to try relaxation techniques, such as: Yoga, meditation or mindfulness. Taking a shower or bath. Try breathing in and out slowly – some people find it helpful to count while doing this. Taking a walk in nature.  Other activities. Practical activities may help to distract you. They can also help you stay connected to the present moment. Activities could include things like: Gardening. Cleaning or tidying. Cooking. Crafts. Arts can be helpful in expressing your feelings, such as: Painting. Music. Writing. Making time in your day for other activities you enjoy, such as: Gaming. Reading. Watching films. For more ideas, see our pages on arts and creative therapies , nature and mental health , sleep problems , stress , relaxation and mindfulness . Think about your diet. It can be difficult to maintain a healthy diet when we’re struggling with our mental health. But eating regularly can keep your blood sugar stable and really make a difference to your mood and energy levels. For more tips see our pages on food and mood. I put on weight since I started medication so I have started eating really healthily. I think this has helped my depression too. Try some physical activity. Physical activity can have a positive impact on our mood. It can be really helpful to focus on your body and physical surroundings. Moving your body may also help you to sleep better. Activities may include: A regular walk outdoors. Swimming. Yoga or meditation. Health walks are organised locally in some areas. Your GP surgery may organise a weekly walking group. Some doctors will also prescribe an exercise programme.  Exercise is very important. If I feel I have too much energy, swimming or a fast long walk can really calm me down and help me sleep. On a low day I might not be up for a swim, but a walk into town really helps me bring my mind and body together. Visit a recovery college. You may also find it helpful to find a recovery college. They offer courses about mental health and recovery in a supportive environment. You can find local providers on the Mind Recovery Net website ."
"Treatment for schizoaffective disorder. Each person's experience of schizoaffective disorder will vary, as will the treatments that work best for them. Different treatments may be helpful for symptoms of psychosis, mania or depression. If you're experiencing a combination of symptoms, you may need a combination of treatments. Or you may need different types of treatment at different times. On this page you can find information on: Talking therapies. Arts therapies. Family intervention. Medication. These are taken from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the treatment of schizophrenia , which also covers schizoaffective disorder. Talking therapies. You may be offered some form of counselling or psychotherapy, also known as talking therapies . The main type of therapy suggested by NICE in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) . CBT may help you to connect your thoughts, feelings and behaviour with your symptoms. It can also help you to develop ways of coping with difficult experiences. Some other types of treatment may be helpful, including mindfulness-based therapies or psychodynamic therapy . For more information see our pages on talking therapies . I have found talking therapies to be really helpful, and a way to learn how to cope with stressful events and look after myself better. Arts therapies. Art, music, dance or drama therapies may help you to express how you are feeling, especially if it's difficult to talk about things. These kinds of therapies may help you come to terms with traumatic events that you may have experienced in the past. You might find that arts therapies are enough to manage your symptoms on their own. Or they might work best alongside another treatment, such as medication. There is no ‘right’ approach. What works for you as an individual is the right approach. For further information see our pages on arts and creative therapies . Family intervention. This is a form of treatment that aims to provide support for the whole household. It can help your family, or the people you live with, to understand: What you're going through. How their responses may help or make matters worse for you, as well as each other. What's helpful and unhelpful for you. For example, if you're very distressed and your family members are very worried about you, they may focus too much attention on you without meaning to. This might make you feel more distressed. Family intervention can help you: Understand how your experience and symptoms affect those living with you. Manage your symptoms and think of ways to cope with problems. Communicate your needs with the people around you. For more information, speak to your community mental health team or psychiatrist. If you're a friend or family member of someone with schizoaffective disorder, see our page on how friends and family can help . Medication. Depending on your symptoms and needs, you may be offered medication. You may be prescribed: An antipsychotic, to help with symptoms of psychosis or mania. A mood stabiliser, to help prevent or reduce the symptoms of mood episodes. An antidepressant, to help treat depressive symptoms. If you also experience symptoms of mania, you're unlikely to be prescribed antidepressants alone. This is because there's a risk of them triggering manic episodes. Depending on your symptoms, you may only be offered one type of drug. But a combination of drugs may be offered to help with the different symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Remember: always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medications together. The medications could interact badly with each other. Medication (especially antipsychotics) can have an impact on your physical health. You should receive regular check-ups from your GP on your weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol and heart function. Smoking can affect the type of side-effects you may get from medication. If you smoke, you may be offered support to stop.  Our pages on coming off medication give guidance on how to come off medication safely. For more information, see our pages on medication , antipsychotics , lithium and other mood stabilisers and antidepressants . Medication can really help some of us. But it isn't right for everyone. Before deciding to take any drug, it's important that you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice. If you don’t understand any aspect of a medication you're offered, don’t be afraid to ask as many questions as you feel you need to. I think medicine can help with short term psychotic issues, but the underlying issues and depression side of things has been better dealt with through therapy and lifestyle changes."
"Helping someone with schizoaffective disorder. This section is for the friends and family of someone who has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Support from family and friends can play an important role in helping someone recover from an episode of schizoaffective disorder. It may reduce the likelihood of them having further episodes. It can also be stressful to care for or support somebody. You may need support for yourself. This page will offer some suggestions on how you can help others and yourself: Understand the diagnosis. Ask how you and others can help. Get help in an emergency. Get support for yourself. Understand the diagnosis. Learning more about schizoaffective disorder can help you: Recognise early symptoms or triggers. Give you the confidence to discuss problems and offer help. React calmly in difficult situations and work towards a positive outcome. If someone is experiencing symptoms of psychosis , such as hearing voices , it may be helpful if you: Accept that the voices are real for them, even if you can't hear them. Focus on how they're feeling, rather than what they're experiencing. Help them manage their symptoms. For example, you could suggest distractions. Ask how you and others can help. Ask them directly how you can be most helpful. These are some ways you could help: Support them to get treatment or accessing a particular service. Keep them company if they're feeling anxious about going to something new, such as an appointment or activity. Check in with them regularly for a chat if you're not nearby. Support them in making decisions. Even if they ask you to act on their behalf, try to encourage them to make their own decisions. Respect the choices they make, even if they're not what you'd choose for yourself. Be clear about what your own limits are in terms of what you can help with. Help them get alternative support if necessary. For example, it may be possible to find an independent advocate to help them. When they’re feeling well, it may be helpful to discuss how you can help them in a crisis. Or if they’re at the start of another episode. You might: Encourage them to write a crisis plan. Discuss and look out for symptoms. Be aware or make a note of their triggers. This can help them to avoid crises or manage them differently in future where possible. For further information see our pages on supporting someone to seek help , advocacy and planning for a crisis . My fiancée isn't afraid to talk to me if she thinks I am getting worse. This has helped me notice changes myself. Get help in an emergency. If you think your friend or family member may be at risk of hurting themselves or others, it may be necessary to consider a Mental Health Act assessment for them. The nearest relative , as defined under the Mental Health Act , can request that the person at risk be given a mental health assessment by an approved mental health professional . This assessment involves considering treatment options. This may include deciding if the person should be admitted to hospital under the Mental Health Act. For further information see our pages on the Mental Health Act , crisis services , sectioning , and the nearest relative . Get support for yourself. It can be very upsetting when someone you're close to is struggling with their mental health. You may find it helpful to get support in coping with your own feelings, either through talking therapy or peer support , where you can talk to other people who have similar experiences. This support may be available at a local Mind or other carers' groups, such as Carers UK . Carers are also entitled to have their own needs for practical and emotional support assessed by social services. This is called a carer's assessment. A number of national and local voluntary organisations provide help and information for carers on these topics. For further information, see our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else , managing stress and maintaining your wellbeing ."

"What is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia is a complicated mental health problem related to psychosis . There's lots of misconceptions about it. Even mental health professionals don't all agree about it. But the reality is that about 1 in every 100 people get this diagnosis at some point in their life. This page covers: Symptoms of schizophrenia. Diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Misconceptions about schizophrenia. Symptoms of schizophrenia. Many experiences and behaviours can be part of schizophrenia. They can start suddenly, or they might develop gradually over time. Each person's experience is unique. A doctor might suggest you have schizophrenia if you experience some of the following: a lack of interest in things. feeling disconnected from your emotions. difficulty concentrating. wanting to avoid people. hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things others don't. delusions (strong beliefs that others don't share), including paranoid delusions. disorganised thinking and speech. not wanting to look after yourself. Hallucinations and delusions are types of psychosis . I have bizarre delusions which include psychic battles in which people around me can be perceived as either 'good' or 'evil'. Sometimes I am in a different time zone or move between periods of history in different lives. You might also find that you: aren't able to carry on with day-to-day activities, like going to work or taking care of yourself. become upset, confused or suspicious of other people or particular groups (like strangers, or people in authority). disagree with people who think something is wrong. feel worried or afraid of seeking help. Sometimes I feel thoughts are being put in my head and that people are reading my thoughts. Positive and negative symptoms Professionals sometimes talk about schizophrenia symptoms as being 'positive' and 'negative'. But this doesn't mean 'good' or 'bad'. Positive symptoms are experiences or behaviours that the condition adds to your life. Like hearing or seeing things that others don't, or having a belief that something is real or true when it isn't. Negative symptoms are experiences or behaviours that the condition takes away from your life. Like finding things less interesting or enjoyable, moving your body less, or having less motivation. Diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Diagnosing schizophrenia is complicated - there's no straightforward test for it. And views on this diagnosis have been changing over the years. Many people think that it may actually be several overlapping conditions, rather than one single condition. If you're experiencing symptoms, it's a good idea to start by talking to your doctor . They may refer you to a mental health specialist, who can assess you by asking you questions. Most people diagnosed with schizophrenia are aged between 18 and 35. It seems to affect roughly the same number of men and women.  Issues with the term 'schizophrenia' add remove Some people argue that because there isn't a clear definition of schizophrenia, doctors shouldn't use this term at all. Especially because this diagnosis can feel stigmatising. Others think that the name of the condition doesn't matter - what matters more is finding ways to help people with their individual symptoms and needs. If you've been given this diagnosis, it might help to think of it as a tool for treating what you're currently experiencing. Not as a definite condition or label that you will have to live with forever. Conditions with similar symptoms to schizophrenia add remove There are also several other conditions that share many of the same symptoms of schizophrenia. These include: schizoaffective disorder. some types of personality disorders (specifically schizotypal and schizoid personality disorder). bipolar disorder. It's also possible to experience an episode of psychosis (one of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia) without having any particular condition. So doctors might find it hard to decide which diagnosis best fits your specific experiences. It's also possible to have more than one diagnosis at once. What to do if you disagree with your diagnosis add remove If you're worried that your schizophrenia diagnosis doesn't match how you feel, it's important to discuss it with your mental health team. If you're not happy with how you're being treated, you can complain about health and social care . Or there are steps you can take if you feel that the details in your medical records are wrong .  What was real and what was not? I couldn't tell the difference any longer and it was exhausting. Inequality and discrimination Doctors are far more likely to diagnose Black people with schizophrenia than White people. But there's no biological evidence that being Black makes you more prone to it. And up until 11 years old, Black children don't have poorer mental health than others of their age. The explanation for this might be to do with: Differences in life experiences. Black people in the UK are more likely to experience things like discrimination, racism, social deprivation and migration (having to move home to a totally new place or culture). These kinds of highly stressful life experiences may trigger schizophrenia. Differences in access to early support, before problems become more severe. Unconscious bias and lack of cultural competence among doctors. Some doctors may interpret similar symptoms differently in Black patients and White patients. They may make assumptions based on racial stereotypes. This may lead them to diagnose some conditions more or less often in Black people. Mind is working to remove inequality of opportunity in the mental health sector. Read about our equality work and our campaigning work . You can become a campaigner for a fairer system. More recently my symptoms have included voices outside my head, feelings that people are talking about me and spying on me. Misconceptions about schizophrenia. There's lots of misinformation in the media about schizophrenia. Stories in the news and on TV shows are often sensationalised and misleading. The truth is: It does not mean someone has a 'split personality'. This is a term that does not accurately describe schizophrenia. The symptoms of schizophrenia relate more to someone's experiences than their personality. It does not mean that someone is dangerous or violent. Most people with schizophrenia do not commit violent crimes. Some research suggests that the risk may be slightly higher among people who have this diagnosis than people who don't. But it's not clear that schizophrenia is the cause. Evidence shows that factors like drug and alcohol misuse are far more likely to play a part in violence. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be victims of crime – or to harm themselves – than to harm someone else. It can be really upsetting to encounter negative attitudes. But there are things you can do.  For further information on schizophrenia see our pages on causes , self-care , treatment , and what others can do to help . The stigma of being violent and dangerous is the worst for me. I am a caring and empathetic soul who would do anything for the people I love."
"What causes schizophrenia? Schizophrenia can have a range of causes. There is a lot that researchers still don't know and it is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic, personal and environmental factors. These factors will be different for everybody but may include: Stressful life events. Drug and alcohol use. Genetic inheritance. Differences in brain chemistry. Stressful life events. Highly stressful or life-changing events may sometimes trigger schizophrenia. These can include: being abused or harassed. losing someone close to you. being out of work. feeling lonely or isolated. having money problems. becoming homeless. Sometimes stressful events like these are called trauma. For more information on how these experiences can affect your mental health see our pages on trauma . The onset of schizophrenia for me was sudden and dramatic, though it followed a period of depression and acute stress. A really compelling and powerful voice started to try to control me. Drug and alcohol use. Some people may develop symptoms of schizophrenia after using cannabis or other recreational drugs . Researchers still aren't sure whether using recreational drugs directly causes schizophrenia, or if people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to use recreational drugs. If you already have schizophrenia, research shows that using recreational drugs may worsen your symptoms. Some studies suggest that people who use high-potency cannabis ('skunk') when in recovery are more likely to have a relapse too. Drinking alcohol and smoking may also stop medication from effectively treating your symptoms.  Genetic inheritance. You are more likely to have schizophrenia if you have a parent or sibling who has experienced psychosis. Researchers aren't yet sure why but they think that some genes might make it more likely. Living in certain environments seems to increase your risk of schizophrenia too. For example, some studies suggest that living in cities increases the likelihood, but researchers don't yet know why. Differences in brain chemistry. Studies show that people can be more likely to experience schizophrenia if their brain development was disrupted during pregnancy or early childhood. Changes in brain structure do not appear in everyone with schizophrenia though. Some chemicals also seem to behave differently in the brains of people who experience schizophrenia. These chemicals are thought to include dopamine, which helps to carry messages between brain cells. Some research suggests that an imbalance between certain neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin, may be one of the causes behind schizophrenia. Antipsychotics, which are sometimes used to treat schizophrenia, can help to lower dopamine levels. For more information see our pages on antipsychotics . More recently my physical health has deteriorated. I have become more agoraphobic and find group settings harder than before."
"How can I help myself? Many people who get a schizophrenia diagnosis are able to live happy and fulfilling lives, even if they continue to have symptoms. It can help to: Look out for warning signs add remove If you are becoming unwell, there might be signs you could spot early on. These will be different for everyone but could include: feeling anxious or stressed. sleeping less well. feeling suspicious or fearful. hearing quiet voices. finding it hard to concentrate. avoiding other people. Noticing when you are becoming unwell You might find you can learn to recognise signs that you are feeling less well. It could help to: Pay attention to what triggers your symptoms. Some activities, situations or people might seem to have a particular effect. Ask other people to help. You could ask someone you trust to let you know if they notice changes in your moods or behaviour. Keep going to appointments. It's best to carry on going to any appointments for treatment, support or check-ups, even if you're feeling better. Try a mood diary. There are many online mood diaries which you may find helpful for tracking any changes in mood and warning signs. See our useful contacts page for more information. You might want to share observations with your close family, friends or care team so they can help support you, whether it's listening to you when you're having a bad day, helping you keep on top of your commitments, or being aware of your triggers. Plan for more difficult times add remove If you're feeling less well you might not be able to tell people what help you want, so it could be helpful to plan ahead. It can also help to talk to someone you trust about how you would like to be helped if you are in a crisis.  Look after your physical health add remove Try to get enough sleep. Sleeping well can make you feel calmer and more able to cope. If you feel tired, you are more likely to feel stressed or worried and find it difficult to manage your symptoms. See our advice on sleep problems. Try to eat a balanced diet. Following a healthy diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables can help your wellbeing. Eating regularly can also help avoid psychosis being brought on by changes to your blood sugar levels. See our advice on food and mood. Smoking and antipsychotics Smoking can change the effects of antipsychotic drugs . If you smoke and are prescribed antipsychotics, it's particularly recommended that you try to give up. It's best to talk to a doctor first because: they can help you with giving up smoking. they might need to adjust your prescription. Alcohol and recreational drugs can also affect the way your medication works. See our information on recreational drugs and alcohol . Cut down on stress add remove Too much stress can make the symptoms of schizophrenia worse and increase the chances of you becoming unwell. It could help to spend time outside in green space or try doing some exercise like walking, swimming or yoga. You might need to cut down on the number of responsibilities you have – it could help to explore support services in your area. For more suggestions, see our information on coping with stress . Do things you enjoy add remove It's important for mental health to keep doing things you enjoy, or if you struggle to know what you enjoy it helps to spend some time exploring different things to work this out. Doing things you enjoy can boost your confidence and help you stay well, whether it's cooking, listening to music or doing DIY. Some people find that doing something creative like drama, drawing or sewing helps them express themselves and deal with difficult emotions.

Maintain relationships add remove Feeling connected to other people is an important part of staying well. It can help you to feel valued, confident and more able to face difficult times. Feeling lonely or isolated could make your symptoms worse. If you don't feel you have strong connections with people or you'd like to make more, it could help to explore support services and peer support . Use peer support add remove When you have schizophrenia it can sometimes feel like no one understands. You might find it very helpful to talk to other people who have the same diagnosis or a related one, such as schizoaffective disorder or psychosis . A great way to do this can be peer support , which can help you: feel more positive about the future. increase your self-esteem. find friends. recognise patterns in your experiences. develop and discuss ways of coping. identify early signs of crisis. take active steps to manage your situation. Various organisations run peer support. The Hearing Voices Network hosts groups across the UK for people who hear, see or sense things that others don't. To find peer support you could: see our list of useful contacts. use our peer support directory. ask if your local Mind runs peer support. try an online peer support community like Side by Side. If you don't feel ready to try peer support but need to talk to someone, many national and local organisations run helplines that you can call in a crisis, such as Samaritans or SANEline . Talking to a trained listener could give you some support and help you make sense of what you're feeling and what's happening. My recovery has been gradual and in stages… No matter how bad I feel, I can now manage my worst days until I get to a better place mentally."
"What treatments are there for schizophrenia? Experiences of schizophrenia will vary from person to person, as will the treatments that work best for them. On this page you can find information on: Talking therapies. Medication. Arts and creative therapies. Family intervention. Can I recover from schizophrenia? There isn't currently a cure for schizophrenia. Some people find many of their symptoms get better with treatment, while others find that they stop for long periods or never come back. For other people schizophrenia is something they learn to live with long-term. Talking therapies. The main type of talking therapy recommended for the treatment of schizophrenia is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , which helps you identify and change any negative thoughts or behaviour that is making your life hard. CBT aims to help you: cope with symptoms of psychosis such as delusions or hearing voices. ease stress so your symptoms don't get worse. manage any side effects from medication. cope with other problems like social anxiety and depression, which people with schizophrenia may also experience. Talking therapies for schizophrenia should focus on helping you cope with your symptoms, rather than trying to convince you that your beliefs or experiences are wrong. With all types of counselling or psychotherapy, the most important thing is the quality of the relationship you develop with your therapist. Therapy is far more likely to be successful if you find your therapist supportive and helpful. Some research suggests that schizophrenia is caused by trauma at a young age, so it may also be worth exploring the option of psychodynamic therapy . This type of therapy will help you to understand deep-rooted or unconscious thoughts. For more information see our pages on talking therapy and counselling , which includes advice on how to find a therapist or counsellor . A lot of people want help with understanding why they are experiencing their symptoms and want help to live their lives without distress. The goal isn't always to eradicate symptoms but to understand them, tolerate distress and address any deeper problems. Medication. If you are first diagnosed during a psychotic episode, you are likely to be offered medication. Doctors usually prescribe antipsychotic drugs (also known as neuroleptic drugs or major tranquillisers) to help with schizophrenia. Medication for schizophrenia affects people in different ways. Some people find it helps reduce symptoms of psychosis, while others don't feel much better. When taking antipsychotics for schizophrenia, you may find that you: have side effects – it's best to tell your doctor about these. need to try more than one type of medication before you find what works for you. take them for a short time only, or need to be on them long-term.  Medication really helps some people but isn’t right for others. Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.  If you want to stop taking medication Some people find antipsychotics unhelpful or want to stop taking medication because they feel better. It's important not to stop suddenly as this can cause withdrawal symptoms. Reducing your dose slowly is important. It's best to speak to your doctor or care team if you want to stop taking medication, even if you don't think you need it any more.  It's also a good idea to talk to your care team about any over-the-counter medicines or complementary therapies you want to try, in case they interfere with your medication. Arts and creative therapies. Art, music, dance or drama therapies may help you express how you are feeling, especially if you find it difficult to talk about things or feel distant from your feelings. They can also help you come to terms with traumatic events that you may have experienced in the past and which might be contributing to your psychotic experiences. As with all treatments, different things work for different people at different times in their lives - it's not easy to predict which type of therapy you will find useful. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that doctors consider arts therapies for everyone with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and similar problems like schizoaffective disorder and psychosis .  I think medicine can help with short term psychotic issues, but the underlying issues and depression side of things has been better dealt with through therapy and lifestyle changes. Family intervention. Family intervention focuses on helping family members talk to each other about what helps, solve problems and plan for a crisis. Your GP or community mental health team (CMHT) will be able to find out if this is available in your area. For more information on treatment for schizophrenia, including a list of questions you might want to ask your doctor, see NICE's schizophrenia treatment guidelines . I've had one major and three minor episodes but am able to lead a pretty normal life. I've made good friends through my experience but am more distant with others. I'd say to others that you can get through the worse times and to always have hope."
"How can friends and family help? This information is for the friends and family of someone who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. If someone close to you has schizophrenia, it can be hard to know how to help, but there are lots of things you can try. This page offers some suggestions on how you can: Ask how you and others can help. Focus on feelings, not experiences. Notice what's going well. Find out more about schizophrenia. Plan ahead for difficult times. Look after yourself. Ask how you and others can help. Ask what help they would find useful. This might include helping with everyday things like shopping or housework, taking them to appointments or reminding them to take their medication if they struggle to remember on their own.  If someone doesn't want help People who experience schizophrenia may not realise they are unwell until they get treatment. It can be hard to persuade someone to see a doctor if they don't want to, or if they don't think anything is wrong. Our information on supporting someone else to seek help for a mental health problem has some suggestions on things you could try. Focus on feelings, not experiences. You might feel unsure what to say or do when someone sees or believes something you don't – but it's important to remember that their experiences feel real to them. It can help if you focus on how they are feeling, rather than talking about what is real or true. Instead of denying their experience it can help to say something like ""That sounds really frightening, is there somebody you could talk to about it?"". If someone turns round and says it's not real, it just makes you feel more alone than ever. Notice what's going well. It can be hard seeing someone close to you experience schizophrenia. They might find it hard to think clearly, have problems understanding what is real, stop taking care of themselves or avoid seeing people. Try to notice positive things too. It can help to set small, realistic goals to aim for rather than focusing on what they can't do. It's also important to remember that losing interest and motivation are part of having schizophrenia and not something the person is choosing to do. Find out more about schizophrenia. It could help to learn about the symptoms they might experience and the coping strategies they could find useful. You may find it helpful to read personal stories or speak to others in the same situation. See our useful contacts page for organisations that can help with this. Getting advice from professionals If you are caring for someone with schizophrenia, you should be able to talk to their doctor, care team or other professionals involved in their care. Even if someone doesn't want medical details to be shared with you, it should still be possible for you to ask for advice and information. They should also talk to you about your needs as a carer . You might find it helpful to think about what questions you particularly want to ask. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has a list for family members and carers of useful questions to ask doctors about schizophrenia . Plan ahead for difficult times. When your friend or relative is feeling well, it can be helpful to discuss with them how you can help if a crisis happens, or if they are at the start of another episode. You could: encourage them to write a crisis plan. discuss which symptoms you can look out for. get to know their triggers and plan how to cope with them. This can help them to avoid crises or manage them differently in future where possible. When having these conversations, make sure you also think about how much you can cope with and try to only offer support that you feel able to give. It is important to look after yourself too. For more information see our pages on planning for a crisis , helping someone else seek help , advocacy and advance decisions . Lonely, confused, isolated, scared, prejudiced against. That's how family members feel. Look after yourself. It can be distressing when someone you are close to experiences schizophrenia symptoms. It's important to invest energy into looking after yourself too. You may find it helpful to get support coping with your feelings, either through peer support , where you can talk to other people with similar experiences, or talking therapy and counselling . This support may be available at a local Mind or other carers’ groups, such as Carers UK . "

"What is seasonal affective disorder (SAD)? Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that you experience during particular seasons or times of year. Depression is a low mood that lasts for a long time, and affects your everyday life. If you have SAD, you'll experience depression during some seasons in particular, or because of certain types of weather or temperature. You can experience it in winter or summer. It's like having your own portable black cloud. It's common to be affected by changing seasons and weather, or to have times of year when you feel more or less comfortable. For example, you might find that your mood or energy levels drop when it gets colder or warmer, or notice changes in your sleeping or eating patterns. But if your feelings are interfering with your everyday life, it could be a sign that you have depression. And if they keep coming back at the same time of year, doctors might call this seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or 'seasonal depression'. In the weeks before the clocks go back, I start to feel sluggish and down. It's harder to keep to my morning routine of going out for a walk before breakfast because it's wet, cold and dark. What are the symptoms of SAD? If you have SAD, you might experience some of the signs and symptoms below. But it's different for different people, and can vary season to season, so you might also have other kinds of feelings which aren't listed here: Lack of energy. Difficulty concentrating. Not wanting to see people. Feeling sad, low, tearful, guilty or hopeless. Feeling anxious, angry and agitated. Being more prone to physical health problems, such as colds, infections or other illnesses. Sleeping too much, or difficulty waking up (common with SAD in winter). Sleeping too little, or waking up a lot (common with SAD in summer). Changes in your appetite, for example feeling hungrier or not wanting to eat. Losing interest in sex or physical contact. Suicidal feelings. Other symptoms of depression. If you also have other mental health problems , you might find that things get worse at times when you're affected by SAD. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. I just can't stay awake and the thought of having to go out, stay awake, make conversation. I just can't do it. I close the curtains in the evening and wish it was dark so I could go to bed early but it's broad daylight. I need to sleep and withdraw again from the world. Are there common misconceptions about SAD? Lots of people have heard of SAD, but this doesn't mean that they understand what it's like or how you're affected. It doesn't mean you 'just feel a bit low in winter'. There are many factors that can cause it or make it worse, and it can affect your life just as much as other types of depression. It can be frustrating and upsetting if people don't understand this, but it's important to remember that you are not alone.  Misconceptions surrounding SAD. During this time I feel down, upset and ready to cry at even the tiniest thing. Read Vicky's story"
"What causes SAD? The exact causes of SAD aren't clear – a range of different factors are likely to contribute and these can vary a lot between different people. Research suggests that the causes are similar to causes of depression , but there are also factors which can lead specifically to SAD. Possible causes of SAD include: Effects of light. Disrupted body clock. Problems with melatonin and serotonin levels. Weather and temperatures. Effects of light. When light hits the back of your eye, messages go to the part of your brain that controls sleep, appetite, sex drive, temperature, mood and activity. If there isn't enough light, these functions can slow down and gradually stop. Some people seem to need a lot more light than others. This may mean they're more likely to get SAD during the winter months. It's like someone has switched off the light suddenly. I'm plunged into darkness, which paralyses me and keeps me pinned down to my bed. Disrupted body clock. Your brain sets your body clock by the hours of daylight. One theory is that if you experience SAD in the winter, this part of your brain isn't working in the same way. This could mean your body clock is out of sync with daylight, leading to tiredness and depression. Some researchers think this is because your sleep pattern starts at a different time. Is SAD more common in certain countries? SAD is thought to be more common in countries where there are greater changes in the weather and in daylight hours during different seasons. This includes England and Wales. The evening is endless. I would watch the clock and feel trapped in the dark. Problems with melatonin and serotonin levels. When it's dark, your brain produces a hormone called melatonin which helps your body get ready for sleep. The levels of serotonin, a brain chemical that affects your mood, are also affected by how much sunlight you get. Some people with winter SAD seem to produce higher levels of melatonin and lower level of serotonin during winter. Research suggests these can contribute to winter SAD, but the exact relationship between them isn't clear. When winter comes and I feel the change in the seasons, I feel more drained. I find it very hard to motivate myself into getting dressed or out of bed. Weather and temperatures. We all have different experiences of particular seasons and types of weather. You might feel particularly uncomfortable in hotter or colder temperatures, which could contribute to you developing depression (or any existing depression worsening) at those times. While more people are aware of SAD happening in winter, some people have more difficulty in warmer weather. Some studies have suggested that summer SAD is linked to higher temperatures and humidity. But more research is needed to understand why. Sunshine and heat make me feel defensive, misanthropic, angry, anxious, resentful and impatient. I don't want to see anyone, go anywhere or do anything. Even bright, low winter light depresses me. I feel under siege. Do stressful times of year cause SAD? SAD is diagnosed if your depression has a seasonal pattern. Some of us might have other times of the year, we find especially difficult, such as Christmas or bereavement anniversaries when we feel depressed. Some other mental health problems can also have a seasonal pattern, like bipolar disorder . These feelings aren't necessarily a form of SAD but they can still mean that you need extra support at certain times of year. Our self-care tips for SAD have some suggestions for you to think about, and our pages on coping with loneliness and stress may also be helpful."
"How can I help myself? Living with SAD can be difficult, but there are lots of things you can do to help yourself cope. This page has some suggestions for you to consider. Different things work for different people at different times, so if something doesn't feel possible just now try not to put pressure on yourself. You can always try something else or come back to it another time. For example: Talk to someone. Keep a diary. Plan for difficult times. Try peer support. Learn ways to relax. Look after your physical health. Winter SAD - practical day-to-day tips add remove If SAD affects you during winter, there are particular things you could try that might help. You could: Make the most of natural light. It might help to spend time in natural light, for example going for walks, spending time in parks or gardens, or simply sitting near a window. This seems to be helpful if you experience SAD in winter. Plan ahead for winter. For example, try to make meals in advance and freeze them if you know you are likely to lack the energy to do this during the most difficult period. I try to get some natural light during the day just by being outside, maybe tidying up the garden or taking my dog for a walk. Exercise in natural light is really helpful. Summer SAD - practical day-to-day tips add remove If SAD affects you during hot weather, there are particular things you could try that might help. You could: Drink plenty of water so that you stay hydrated. Find ways to keep cool, such as finding shade or wearing loose clothing. Visit indoor places. Staying inside all the time could make you feel isolated. It could help to try doing activities indoors, like visiting your local library or going to the cinema. Plan ahead for summer. For example, try to avoid going outside at the hottest times of day where possible. Talk to someone. It can be hard to reach out when you're not feeling well, but it might help to share how you're feeling. If you don't feel you can talk to the people around you or you need additional support, you could contact a helpline such as: Samaritans – open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to listen to anything that's upsetting you. You can call 116 123 (free from any phone), email [email protected] or visit some branches in person. You can also call the Welsh Language Line on 0300 123 3011 (7 pm–11 pm every day). SANEline – support for people experiencing a mental health problem or supporting someone else. You can call them on 0300 304 7000 (4.30 pm–10 pm every day).

For more options, see our page on helplines and listening services . Mind's Infoline can also help you find services that can support you. SAD is like a cold blanket that keeps depression and anxiety wrapped close to me. When I feel I can, I go outside and face the sun, close my eyes and focus on the light and warmth. Keep a diary. You might find it helps to keep a note of your symptoms, including when they start and if particular things seem to trigger them, including changes in the weather. This could help you notice any patterns. You could also make a note of things that feel helpful for you or which seem to make things worse. This can be helpful because SAD affects you at some times and not others, so you might not easily remember these details. I keep a daily diary and it's helpful to look back over the years and see how each year I've felt the downward spiral starting. Plan for difficult times. If you've noticed your symptoms follow a pattern, you may be able to work out when they're most likely to start in the future. This may help you put things in place for those times. For example, you could: Re-arrange stressful activities or events for another time. Plan relaxing activities that might help improve your mood. Plan ahead, such as stocking up on things you need. Make more spare time to rest or do things you enjoy. Create a self-care box. December is dark but the festive lights and cheerfulness are an antidote. I now put up my Christmas decorations really early (1 st Dec) as a way of coping with my SAD symptoms and stretching out the 'fairy-lights antidote' for a whole month. Try peer support. Peer support brings together people who have had similar experiences. Some people find this very helpful. To find peer support, you could: Contact Mind's Infoline or your local Mind to see what support there is in your area. Explore our peer support directory. Ask your GP for details of support groups, and if you live in England you can also contact your local psychological therapies service. See if your local library or community centre has details of groups in your area. Try an online peer support community like Mind's Side by Side or SANE's support forum. If you're seeking peer support on the internet, it's important to look after your online wellbeing. For more information see our pages on online mental health and peer support . I have a dawn simulator alarm clock which lights up gradually to fill my space in the bedroom with a glow. Learn ways to relax. Manage stress. It can help to think of ways to manage pressure and build your emotional resilience.  Try some relaxation techniques. Learning to relax can help you look after your wellbeing when you are feeling stressed, anxious or busy.  Spend time in nature. Being outside in green space can help you feel more in touch with your surroundings.  I get up early, wrap up warm, put on my pedometer and walk in the dark to enjoy the solitude. By the time people are up and about, I'm back home having walked a good few miles and feel so much better for it. Look after your physical health. Looking after your physical health can make a difference to how you feel emotionally. For example, it can help to: Think about your diet. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can be difficult when you have SAD. But trying your best to manage this where possible could make a difference to your mood and energy levels. Try to do some physical activity. If you find exercise a challenge remember that even gentle activities like yoga, swimming or walking can be a big boost to your mood.  Get help with sleep problems. For lots of people who experience SAD, sleeping too little or too much can be a problem.  Try to look after your hygiene. When you're experiencing SAD, it's easy for hygiene to not feel like a priority. But small things, like taking a shower and getting fully dressed whether or not you're going out of the house, can make a big difference to how you feel. Try to avoid drugs and alcohol. While you might want to use drugs or alcohol to cope with any difficult feelings, in the long run they can make you feel worse.  In summer my eyes, skin, throat and muscles ache. I find it difficult to concentrate. I can't take in information, and my short-term memory is unreliable. Evenings come as a relief. I feel my muscles relaxing as the sun goes down.

"What treatments are there for SAD? Whether or not your depression seems to be seasonal, it's ok to ask for help at any time. You don't need to wait to see if there's a pattern. This page covers: How can I access treatment? Talking therapies. Medication. Light therapy. Other treatments. What if I don't feel better? How can I access treatment? The first step is usually to visit your GP. If you're given a diagnosis of SAD, this will be based on your symptoms repeatedly following a seasonal pattern, usually for two or more years. Or if the seasonal pattern isn't clear yet you can still get help from your GP for symptoms of depression or anxiety . Our guide to seeking help for a mental health problem has information about talking to your doctor about your mental health, including what might happen at the appointment and making your voice heard . I was well into adulthood before I began to recognise a pattern. Initially I noticed that I often took more sick leave from my job in the winter months. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines say you should be offered the same types of treatments for SAD as for other types of depression, including talking therapies and medication. This is because there isn't currently enough evidence to show whether or not particular treatments help with SAD. You can read the full guidelines on the NICE website , including recommendations on treating SAD . This information uses the term 'seasonal depression' to describe SAD. Talking therapies. There are many different talking therapies that can be effective in treating depression.  My energy levels fluctuated between autumn/winter and spring/summer. I absolutely dreaded the onset of darker days and felt that I was literally shutting down. Medication. You might be offered an antidepressant, either on its own or in combination with talking therapy. This will most commonly be a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . Your GP might recommend you start taking them a few weeks before the season when your symptoms normally begin. Our pages on treatment for depression , treatment for anxiety and antidepressants have more information. Antidepressants have helped to put me in a place where I was more able to cope with counselling. This required a lot of hard work and I had to accept a completely different way of thinking. Medication really helps some people but isn't right for others. Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.  Our pages on coming off medication give guidance on how to come off medication safely. Light therapy. Some people with winter SAD find it helpful to use a light box – a device that gives off strong white or blue light. Or a lamp or alarm clock that simulates dawn. This is sometimes called light therapy. The NHS doesn't usually provide light therapy because there isn't yet much evidence to show it works, although some people find it helpful. So more research needs to be done to establish why it works for some people and not others. You can buy light therapy equipment yourself but unfortunately it tends to be expensive. For more information on how light therapy works and tips on how to choose a light box see the NHS guidance on trying light therapy . Light therapy might not be suitable for you if you're using other treatments that can make your skin sensitive to light. For example: St John's wort. Some antipsychotics. Some antibiotics. If you decide to try using a light box or lamp, you may wish to discuss this with your doctor who can advise on whether it's suitable for you to try. If you have existing eye problems or use a light box regularly, it's also a good idea to talk to an optician and to have regular eye check-ups. Using a light box wasn't perfect but the change was tangible. A real shift. I began to cope better with the dark days and didn't have the all-encompassing desire to get back into bed and stay there. Other treatments. You might also decide to try other treatments alongside, or instead of, talking therapies or medication. These might include: Complementary and alternative therapies. Ecotherapy (nature-based treatments). Arts and creative therapies. Your doctor may be able to refer you to some of these. You can also contact your local Mind to find out what they have available. What if I don't feel better? Your doctor should offer you regular appointments to check how you're doing, and see how well any treatment is working for you. Different things work for different people at different times, and if a particular medication or talking therapy doesn't work for you, your doctor should be able to suggest an alternative. If you've tried a range of treatments and none of them have helped, speak to your doctor about this and they may be able to refer you for additional support. For more suggestions, see our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem . I approached my GP and reported my symptoms but, as my antidepressant was increased, this just added another degree of sedation."
"How can other people help? This page is for family or friends who want to support someone with SAD. If you are supporting a friend or relative who is experiencing SAD it can be hard to know what you can do to help. This page has some suggestions of things you could try while also looking after your own wellbeing. Let them know you are there. Support them to seek help. Don't be critical. Be sensitive when talking about the weather. Ask them what helps. Help them to plan ahead. Stay in touch. Look after yourself. Let them know you are there. Lots of people can find it hard to open up about how they're feeling. One of the most important things you can do is let the person you're worried about know that you care and that it's ok to talk about what they're experiencing. Their self-esteem is very low in the winter months, particularly November and December, as the days get shorter. Support them to seek help. Supporting your friend or loved one to seek help can be really important. It can help to remind them that SAD is a recognised condition like many others, and that they deserve help and support. You can read our information on treatment and self-care for SAD , and encourage them to seek help from their GP.  I can see my family members with winter SAD shutting down through autumn, until in winter they are prone to afternoon naps, shutting themselves away alone in a room, and have a lack of interest in anything. Don't be critical. If you've not experienced SAD yourself, it can be hard to understand why your friend or family member can't just 'snap out of it'. Try not to blame them. They are probably being very critical and harsh towards themselves already. It's also important to not put pressure on them to feel or behave a certain way, for example expecting someone to be active and particularly happy in the summer. Be sensitive when talking about the weather. It's common to describe certain types of weather as being good or bad, for example talking about 'nice weather' or describing rainy days as 'dreary' or 'miserable'. This could make someone with SAD feel criticised or alone, so it might really help if you consider how you talk about different types of weather. Ask them what helps. SAD can affect people in different ways, so it's important to ask your friend or loved one what support they would find most helpful, and what has or hasn't helped them in the past. They may just want your emotional support or there may be specific practical things you could do that could help them cope. What people need can also change over time, so it is a good idea to check in with them regularly to see if anything has changed. Help them to plan ahead. If you have some idea when their symptoms are likely to start, you may want to plan things in advance that might help. For example, you could: Schedule time to offer practical support. Plan activities to help them relax. Make sure there will be people around to offer support. It may also help to avoid planning any activities during the period that they find particularly difficult, and to talk together about what demands they can cope with. For example, you might decide to avoid having guests during difficult times. I try to encourage my winter-suffering family members to think ahead and get helpful things organised for during their difficult time before winter starts, while they still have the energy and ability to do so. Stay in touch. SAD can cause people to feel very isolated. For example, if they don't feel up to joining in with social activities or they struggle to find things they can do during difficult times. It could help to suggest things they might find easier to do such as, in the case of someone who feels worse in hot weather, doing indoor activities like watching a film together. Look after yourself. There are times when supporting someone can be challenging. So it's common to feel overwhelmed at times. It's important to look after your own mental health too. It may help if you: Set boundaries and don't take too much on. It's important to decide what your limits are and how much you are able to help them. Your needs matter too and you'll want to avoid becoming unwell yourself.  Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone. Talk to others about how you're feeling. You may want to be careful about how much information you share about the person you're supporting, but talking about your own feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too. Find support for yourself. The organisations in useful contacts are there to support you too. It could also help to explore peer support and talking treatments. For more suggestions, see our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else , managing stress and looking after your wellbeing ."

"What is self-esteem? Self-esteem is how we value and perceive ourselves. It's based on our opinions and beliefs about ourselves, which can feel difficult to change. We might also think of this as self-confidence. Your self-esteem can affect whether you: Like and value yourself as a person. Can make decisions and assert yourself. Recognise your strengths. Feel able to try new or difficult things. Show kindness towards yourself. Move past mistakes without blaming yourself unfairly. Take the time you need for yourself. Believe you matter and are good enough. Believe you deserve happiness. For me, low self-esteem is the little voice inside my head that says ‘you're rubbish, you're fat, what's the point, you're not cut out for this’ and so on… What can cause low self-esteem? The things that affect our self-esteem are different for everyone. Your self-esteem might change suddenly. Or you might have had low self-esteem for a while​. There are lots of things in life that may contribute to low self-esteem. For example: Being bullied or abused. Experiencing prejudice, discrimination or stigma, including racism. Losing your job or difficulty finding employment. Problems at work or while studying. Physical health problems. Mental health problems. Relationship problems, separation or divorce. Problems with money or housing. Worries about your appearance and body image. Feeling pressure to meet unrealistic expectations, for example through social media. You might have had some of these experiences. And you might have had difficulties that aren't listed here. Or there might not be one particular cause. If you struggle with low self-esteem, it might feel as if making changes will be difficult. But there are things you can try. See our tips to improve your self-esteem for some suggestions. I thought self-hatred was normal. Everyone wakes up every day and looks in the mirror and thinks ‘yeah, I hate that bit about me’, right? Is low self-esteem a mental health problem? Low self-esteem isn't a mental health problem in itself. But mental health and self-esteem can be closely linked. Some of the signs of low self-esteem can be signs of a mental health problem. This is especially if they last for a long time or affect your daily life. For example: Feeling hopeless or worthless. Blaming yourself unfairly. Hating yourself. Worrying about being unable to do things. Having a mental health problem could also cause you to have low self-esteem. And it might feel harder to cope or take steps to improve your self-esteem if you struggle with your mental health. If you are worried about your mental health, our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem have information on how to get support. Every time I tried to praise myself it felt tainted with all the self-doubt and self-hatred that's been there all my life. It was then I realised maybe I needed help."
"How can I improve my self-esteem? This page has some tips and suggestions for improving your self-esteem, or self-confidence. Some people find these ideas useful, but remember that different things work for different people at different times. Only try what you feel comfortable with. Be kind to yourself. Try to recognise positives. Build a support network. Try talking therapy. Set yourself a challenge. Look after yourself. Be kind to yourself. Get to know yourself. For example, what makes you happy and what you value in life. You might find it helpful to write this in a journal. Try to challenge unkind thoughts about yourself. You might automatically put yourself down. If you find yourself doing this, it can help to ask: ""Would I talk to a friend in this way?"". Say positive things to yourself. Some people like to do this in front of a mirror. It can feel strange at first, but you may feel more comfortable the more you do it. Practise saying no. Being assertive can be difficult if you're not used to it. But agreeing to too many things to please others can be draining. It could help to pause, take a breath and think about how you feel before agreeing to do something you don't want to. Try to avoid comparing yourself to others. For example, it might help to limit how much time you spend on social media or online communities. What other people often choose to share about their lives isn't always the full picture. Do something nice for yourself. For example, making your favourite meal or playing a game you enjoy. I've come to realise that people get to choose what they present about themselves online. In reality, no one's life is perfect and everyone has insecurities. Try to recognise positives. Celebrate your successes. No matter how small they may seem, take time to praise yourself. For example, this could be getting outside for a walk or doing some tidying. Accept compliments. You could save them up to look over when you're feeling low or doubting yourself. Ask people what they like about you, if you feel comfortable. They may recognise things that you don't think about yourself. Write a list of things you like about yourself. For example, this could be a skill that you've learnt, or something you do to help other people. I use a gratitude diary, which directly challenges things before I get to a point of feeling overwhelmed and catastrophising everything. Build a support network. Talk to someone you trust. Having someone listen to you and show they care can help. If you aren't able to open up to someone close to you, you could call a helpline to speak to someone anonymously. For example, you could call Samaritans on 116 123. Focus on positive relationships. It might feel difficult to control who you spend time with. But where possible, it can help to spend more time with people who make you feel good about yourself. Try peer support. Making connections with people who have similar or shared experiences can help. For example, online communities like Mind's Side by Side can be a good source of support.  For the first time I thought there is no way that all these negative things can be true with so many people in my life who love me for who I am. Try talking therapy. Talking therapies can help with building self-esteem. They can also help you find ways to cope with experiences that affect how you feel about yourself.  Martial arts has really boosted my self-esteem, I was awful when I started, but I've been doing it for a year now. Even though I have miles to go until I am advanced I still feel like I have really accomplished something. Set yourself a challenge. Try volunteering. You might decide to volunteer your time for something you feel passionate about. For more information on volunteering, see the Volunteer by Do-IT website. Set small goals. This could help things feel more manageable, and give you a greater sense of achievement. Learn something new. For example, this could be trying a new hobby or creative activity. Or taking time to read a book about a new subject. Look after yourself. Try to get enough sleep. Getting too little or too much sleep can have a negative impact on how you feel.  Think about your diet. Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels.  Try to do some physical activity. Being active can help your mental wellbeing. This may include helping to improve your self-esteem.  Spend time outside. Being in green space can often help how you feel.  Practise mindfulness and meditation. For example, you could try Headspace's meditation course for self-esteem. Try to avoid recreational drugs and alcohol. You might want to use recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings about yourself. But in the long run they can make you feel worse and can prevent you from dealing with underlying problems.  Sign up to a self-help programme. For example, you could try our supported self-help programme if you are in Wales. Or you could use the Reading Well books scheme to find books to help with your self-esteem. "

"What is self-harm? Self-harm is when you hurt yourself as a way of dealing with very difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. Some people have described self-harm as a way to: express something that is hard to put into words. turn invisible thoughts or feelings into something visible. change emotional pain into physical pain. reduce overwhelming emotional feelings or thoughts. have a sense of being in control. escape traumatic memories. have something in life that they can rely on. punish themselves for their feelings and experiences. stop feeling numb, disconnected or dissociated (see dissocation and dissociative disorders). create a reason to physically care for themselves. express suicidal feelings and thoughts without taking their own life. After self-harming you may feel a short-term sense of release, but the cause of your distress is unlikely to have gone away. Self-harm can also bring up very difficult emotions and could make you feel worse. Even though there are always reasons underneath someone hurting themselves, it is important to know that self-harm does carry risks. Once you have started to depend on self-harm, it can take a long time to stop. My body comes with a trigger warning. I didn't know how else to cope. I didn't like myself. Read Seaneen's story How do people self-harm? There are lots of different forms of self-harming. Some people use the same one all the time, other people hurt themselves in different ways at different times. Warning : it can be upsetting and potentially triggering to read information about how to self-harm. If you are feeling vulnerable at the moment, you might not want to read the information below. Ways people self-harm add remove Ways people self-harm can include: cutting yourself. poisoning yourself. over-eating or under-eating. exercising excessively. biting yourself. picking or scratching at your skin. burning your skin. inserting objects into your body. hitting yourself or walls. misusing alcohol, prescription and recreational drugs. pulling your hair. having unsafe sex. getting into fights where you know you will get hurt. If you self-harm, it is important that you know how to look after your injuries and that you have access to the first aid equipment you need. LifeSIGNS has information on first aid for self-injury and self-harm. If you’re concerned about an injury or not sure how to look after it, see your GP . I think one of my biggest barriers to getting help was actually not admitting to myself that I had a problem. I used to tell myself, 'I'm only scratching, it's not real self-harm.'"
"Why do people harm themselves? There are no fixed rules about why people self-harm. It really can be very different for everyone. For some people, self-harm is linked to specific experiences and is a way of dealing with something that's either happening at the moment or which happened in the past. For others, the reasons are less clear and can be harder to make sense of. Sometimes you might not know why you hurt yourself. If you don’t understand the reasons for your self-harm, you are not alone and you can still get help. I started self-harming when I was 15 or 16. I can't remember why I decided to start, but that's what I did. Any difficult experience can cause someone to self-harm. Common reasons include: pressures at school or work. bullying. money worries. sexual, physical or emotional abuse. bereavement. homophobia, biphobia and transphobia (see LGBTQIA+ mental health). breakdown of a relationship. loss of a job. an illness or health problem. low self-esteem. an increase in stress. difficult feelings, such as depression, anxiety, anger or numbness. Self-harm proved to me I was real, I was alive. At times it also silenced the chaos in my head, briefly pausing the repetitive flashbacks and body memories. Some people self-harm particular areas of their body that are linked to an earlier trauma. For more information, see our information on trauma . Some people find that certain actions, such as drinking alcohol or taking drugs, increase the likelihood of self-harm, or that self-harm is more likely to happen at certain times (at night, for example). Sometimes people talk about self-harm as attention-seeking. If people make comments like this, it can leave you feeling judged and alone. In reality, a lot of people keep their self-harm private, and it can be painful to have your behaviour misunderstood in this way. However, if you do self-harm as a way of bringing attention to yourself, remember that there is nothing wrong with wanting to be noticed and to have your distress acknowledged and taken seriously. You also deserve a sympathetic response from those around you, including medical professionals. I hated my body and blamed it for what I'd been through, so felt it needed punishing. Learning to accept and respect [my body] was key to overcoming self-harm. Who self-harms? People of all ages and backgrounds self-harm. There is no one typical person who hurts themselves. While self-harm can affect anyone, difficult experiences that can result in self-harm relate more to some people than others. Exam stress, classroom bullying and peer pressure is something that affects young people , for example. Experiencing stigma and discrimination based on your sexual orientation or gender identity is more common for members of the LGBTQIA+ community . Money worries can create greater stress for those on a lower income. These specific pressures can lead to increased tension which may in turn make self-harm more likely."
"How can I help myself now? During intense urges to hurt yourself, it can be hard to imagine that it's possible to do anything else. But there are steps you can take to help you make other choices over time: Understanding your patterns of self-harm add remove Understanding your patterns of self-harm can help you to work out what gives you the urge to self-harm, and recognise when the urge is coming on. Remember, even when you are unable to resist the urge to self-harm, it is helpful to reflect afterwards on what happened. This will enable you to better understand the next time you have similar feelings. Try breaking down your experience into the following: Learn to recognise triggers 'Triggers' are what give you the urge to hurt yourself. They can be people, situations, anniversaries, sensations, specific thoughts or feelings. Practise noting down what was happening just before you self-harmed: Did you have particular thoughts? Did a situation, person or object remind you of something difficult? Become aware of the urge to self-harm Urges can include physical sensations like: racing heart or feelings of heaviness. strong emotions like sadness or anger. a disconnection from yourself or a loss of sensation. repetitive thoughts about harming yourself, or how you might harm yourself. unhealthy decisions, like working too hard to avoid feelings. Recognising your urges helps you take steps towards reducing or stopping self-harm. Try writing down what you notice about your urges, to help you spot them more quickly each time they come. Identify distractions Distracting yourself from the urge to self-harm is a way of giving yourself more breathing space and reducing the intensity of the urge. It can be done when you feel the urge, or as soon as you become aware that you are hurting yourself. I learned distraction techniques. My favourite one was my Positivity Book, which is kind of like a scrap book filled with things which make me happy. Keep a diary One way to help yourself understand your self-harming behaviour is to keep a diary of what happens before, during and after each time you self-harm. It is helpful to do this over a period of time (like a month) so you can start to see patterns. This can be quite an intense experience and can bring up difficult feelings. If you feel confident to try this on your own, make sure you do something relaxing or enjoyable afterwards. If you find doing this distressing, you may want to ask for support from someone you trust. I've learnt that, as my emotional needs were not being met, I used self-harm because I didn't know how to express myself or say what I needed or wanted. A part was also for attention, I was desperate for someone to notice me and help me. Distracting yourself from the urge to self-harm add remove The main way people help themselves when they want to self-harm is through distraction. Different distractions work for different people, and the same distraction won't necessarily work for you every time. For example, distracting yourself from anger feels very different to distracting yourself from fear, so it's important that you have a few different strategies to choose from. The following are simply suggestions. See if you can write your own list of distractions that you've found helpful or that you would like to try out. If you're feeling anger and frustration Here are some distractions you could try: exercise. hit cushions. shout and dance. shake. tear something up into hundreds of pieces. go for a run. Expressing your anger physically, or by doing things like shouting, won't work for everyone and could intensify feelings. Try things out and continue with any that have a positive effect. If you're feeling sadness and fear Here are some distractions you could try: wrap a blanket around you. spend time with an animal. walk in nature. let yourself cry or sleep. listen to soothing music. tell someone how you feel. massage your hands. lie in a comfortable position and breathe in – then breathe out slowly, making your out-breath longer than your in-breath. Repeat until you feel more relaxed. ( If you're feeling a need to control Here are some distractions you could try: write lists. tidy up. declutter. write a letter saying everything you are feeling, then tear it up. weed a garden. clench then relax all your muscles. If you're feeling numb and disconnected Here are some distractions you could try: flick elastic bands on your wrists. hold ice cubes. smell something with strong odour. have a very cold shower. If you're feeling shame Here are some distractions you could try: stop spending time with anyone who treats you unkindly. recognise when you are trying to be perfect and accept that making mistakes is part of being human. remind yourself that there are reasons for how you behave – it is not because you are 'bad'. If you're feeling self-hatred and wanting to punish yourself Here are some distractions you could try: write a letter from the part of you that feels the self-hatred, then write back with as much compassion and acceptance as you can. find creative ways to express the self-hatred, through writing songs or poetry, drawing, movement or singing. do physical exercise (like running or going to the gym) to express the anger that is turned in on yourself. I've learnt that you can't rely on other people or things to save you from self-harm – it has to come from you. Delaying self-harm add remove Another technique is to wait five minutes before you self-harm. This can feel difficult, so don’t worry if you’re not able to wait that long at first. If you can, slowly increase the time you wait and gradually build up the gaps between each time you self-harm. I was determined to stop harming myself. On some occasions I literally sat on my hands until the urge had passed. For some people, distracting or delaying feels a far too simplistic approach to dealing with the complex and deep rooted nature of self-harm. In this case, information on helping yourself long-term might feel more useful. Mental health apps. There are various apps available that you could use to help yourself day-to-day. But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. Would you like some recommendations? We've put together a library of safe apps that meet our high quality standards."
"How can I help myself in the future? There are a number of ways to help yourself in the long term. They include a deeper exploration of the reasons why you self-harm, to help you find alternatives: Accept your feelings add remove If you have been shamed for your feelings, or learnt to shut them down for any other reason, it is very brave to start to face them once more. It can feel very frightening to allow yourself to experience difficult emotions again, and it is important to go very slowly. Perhaps include tools like mindfulness or keep a journal to support and prevent you from becoming overwhelmed. Try some of the online tools, books and worksheets for understanding emotions (Self-injury Support have resources on dealing with feelings). Work alongside a therapist who you trust, to have a positive experience of your feelings being accepted and validated (see our pages on talking therapy and counselling). Try the mindfulness technique of noticing and naming feelings as you become aware of them. I was able to start channelling my feelings into creativity. This gave me an outlet to build a better relationship with myself, and I was able to occupy my hands when feeling really bad until the urge to self-harm had subsided. Build your self-esteem add remove Learning to value yourself and perceive yourself positively makes a big difference to your experience in life. Practise speaking and thinking more kindly about yourself, in the same way as you would about a loved one. Replace repetitive mental urges to hurt yourself with empowered thoughts – for example, 'Even though I feel like hurting myself, I am going to find another way to express how upset I feel.'. Regularly write down three things you appreciate about yourself, no matter how small. Learn to be assertive by expressing boundaries of what does and doesn't feel right for you in your life. Take control of your decisions. Remind yourself that you have responsibility for the choices you make in life, and choose things that feel supportive and nourishing for you. See How to increase your self-esteem for more suggestions. Understand your self-harm in more detail add remove Letting go of self-harm can feel like a really big decision that takes time to make. It can be very helpful to understand your relationship to it in more depth, so that you can put things in place to support the process. The more you understand about why you hurt yourself, and the function that self-harm has had for you, the better equipped you will be to make changes and put effective alternatives in place. The following questions can help you begin the process of understanding your self-harm: How do you feel before and after you hurt yourself? What was the reason you started to hurt yourself? What does self-harm give you now? What are the situations where you are most likely to want to hurt yourself? What are your fears about living without self-harm? What would you miss about self-harm? What else would be useful to understand about your self-harm? I think the best way to stop self-harm is to focus on the underlying issues which trigger you to do it. If you work on these issues, then the self-harm will stop naturally. For more guidance on supporting yourself to stop self-harming see Self-injury Support's information resources, LifeSIGNS' information on alternatives and the Harmless guide to working through self-harm. Look after your general wellbeing add remove Taking care of your health and wellbeing on all levels can help you feel a lot better about yourself. Whatever steps you choose to take, it’s important to be kind to yourself. Here are some suggestions that are known to be helpful: Doing regular physical activity can boost your mood and reduce stress. Eating regular meals with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables can also help with how you feel (see food and mood). Making sure you get enough sleep helps you feel better and more able to cope (see sleep problems). Doing something creative can help you express your feelings. For example, write a song, story or blog, paint, draw or use clay. Spending time doing things that you enjoy, such as seeing friends or going for a walk, is also important. Try to make time to do this every week, no matter what else is going on. Reach out for support add remove Reaching out can feel hard, especially if you worry that people will judge you or you believe other people might not want to help you. Remind yourself that everyone needs support at different times, and that it is OK to ask for help. When you are ready to reach out, choose someone who you trust to talk to about how you are feeling. This could be a friend, family member, counsellor or health professional (see the Treatment and support section for more information). Remember that you are in control of what you say, and you don't have to say anything that you're not ready to share yet. You may also find it helpful to write a list of all the people, organisations and websites that you can go to for help when you are finding things difficult. This will remind you that you are not alone, and where you can get help. See Useful contacts for some suggestions. Having a therapist who would never judge and remained constant and calm made a huge difference in me being able to open up. There is no magic solution or quick fix for self-harm, and making changes can take time and involve periods of difficulty. It is common to make some progress and then get back into old behaviours again. If this happens to you, remind yourself that it's not failing – it is simply part of the process."
"What support and treatment is available? Sometimes outside support is needed to help you make positive changes. You may need to try a few different things to find what works for you, and combine self-help techniques with professional support: Your GP. Talking treatments. Support groups. Online support. Treatment for scars. Your right to help and support. It takes courage to ask for support. It is understandable that you may have concerns that you won't be understood or that you will be pressured to make changes faster than you want to. However, you have the right to receive support that is both empowering and respectful. Any health professional – such as your GP or psychiatrist – should discuss all your options with you, and your views and preferences should be taken into account when making decisions about your treatment. If you receive NHS treatment, it should be in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines . These say that: Any health professionals should treat you in a way that is sensitive and non-judgemental. Ideally, health professionals should be trained in communicating sensitively with people who self-harm, and be aware of potential stigma. Any treatment you are given should be tailored to your individual needs. Your GP. Seeing your GP is often the first step to asking for help and discussing your self-harm confidentially. Your GP may: assess you and let you know about available treatment. prescribe medication for anxiety or depression, or to help with sleeping. refer to your community mental health team (CMHT) which can include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, an occupational therapist and community psychiatric nurse. If they are concerned that your self-harm is a threat to your life, or if you need medical treatment for your injuries, they may suggest you spend time in hospital. Visiting the GP was the best thing I have ever done. It didn’t immediately get better, but that’s where my recovery began. Talking treatments. Talking treatments involve talking with a professional therapist trained to listen with empathy and acceptance. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) and psychodynamic therapy have been shown to be helpful for people who self-harm. If you can afford to, you can pay to see a private, trained and accredited therapist. See the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP), the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) for further details.  Support groups. Support groups are regular meetings with others who have similar experiences to you. Support groups can be peer-led or facilitated. They may focus on specific issues or be more general.  You can find out if there are local groups through Mind Infoline or Self-injury Support . Online support. Online support is an option if you don't feel ready to see someone face-to-face. Email, text, information or forum support is offered by self-harm services – for example National Self Harm Network, Self-injury Support, LifeSIGNS, The Mix and Sane. The content on some self-harm sites can be triggering. Make sure the sites you visit are well moderated and that you know how to protect yourself and others while online.  Treatment for scars. Some people feel that scars from self-harm are an important part of their journey, while others would prefer not to have them. Treatments are available for covering and reducing scarring. For more information see the LifeSIGNS pages on scar reduction and skin camouflage. Things to consider when asking for help. Remember that whoever is supporting you is there to help you and listen to you. Sometimes a therapist or practitioner may ask you to commit to not self-harm during a course of treatment. It is important that you don't feel pressured into making decisions about this, and that anything you decide is realistic for you at the time. It can be tempting to try to cover up the extent of your self-harm, or to lie about it altogether. While this is understandable, if you are able to share your experience it can make a big difference to how you feel. It can help to reduce feelings of shame and isolation, and will increase the chance of you receiving the support you need. It does take a lot of courage to reach out, and it might take more than one conversation to say everything that you'd like to say. Even when I've had to go to A&E, I have lied and pretended my injuries were accidents – which in hindsight is silly as I could have received some emotional support, but I hold such deep shame. If the person supporting you is not trained or experienced in self-harm, it might be useful to ask them to find out more – by reading these pages, for example, or by contacting an organisation for people who self-harm ( Self-injury Support , LifeSIGNS and Harmless have helpful information resources). It can also help if you write down all the things that you'd like to say to the person in advance. This will help you if you feel anxious about expressing your feelings or worried that you might be judged. I have noticed in recent years that nurses and doctors in A&E are more understanding of self-harm, which is great. If you are concerned about your treatment or care, or find it hard to access the support you need, it may be helpful to get an advocate to support you. This could be a friend, family member or professional. You can also contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) for information on making a complaint about NHS services if you need to."
"What can friends and family do to help? This section is for friends and family members who want to support someone they know who self-harms. Finding out that someone you care about self-harms. What helps? What doesn't help? Taking care of yourself. Supporting people to stay safe. Finding out that someone you care about self-harms. Whether someone tells you directly, or you suspect that someone is hurting themselves, it can be difficult to know what to say and how best to approach the situation. You might feel shocked, angry, helpless, responsible or any number of other difficult emotions. Try not to panic or overreact. The way you respond to your friend or family member will have an impact on how much they open up to you and other people about their self-harm in the future. Remember that self-harm is usually someone's way of managing very hard feelings or experiences, and that in the majority of cases it is different to suicidal feelings. What helps? There are lots of things you can do to make a difference to someone you know who self-harms. Your attitude and how you relate to them is one of the key things that can help them feel supported. Here are some things to keep in mind: Try to be non-judgemental. Let the person know that you are there for them. Relate to them as a whole person, not just their self-harm. Try to have empathy and understanding about what they are doing. Let them be in control of their decisions. Offer to help them find support (see Useful contacts). Remind them of their positive qualities and things they do well. Try to have honest communication, where you take responsibility for any fears you have. Having friends I could ring up and talk to about everyday things gave me some respite from the despair. What doesn't help? Sometimes, even with the best will in the world, attempts to support someone can backfire. Here are some potential pitfalls to watch out for: Trying to force change. Acting or communicating in a way that threatens to take control away from your loved one. Either ignoring their injuries or overly focusing on them. Labelling self-harm as 'attention seeking'. Although it often isn't, self-harm can sometimes be a person's way of asking for attention. If so, it is important to remember that there is nothing wrong with wanting attention, and that deep distress can get in the way of someone's ability to be direct about what they need. Take care of yourself. Supporting someone who is self-harming can be a long process with many ups and downs. Taking care of yourself will enable you to stay involved for longer and to keep well. See How to cope when supporting someone else for more information. Helpful things to put in place are: having clear boundaries about how much and what sort of support you can offer. finding out what other support is available. getting support and information for yourself – Young Minds offers support for parents, and Sane and Self-injury Support run support services for people concerned about someone else's mental health. you may find it helpful to try a talking treatment if you are finding things difficult. Supporting people to stay safe. It is common to feel scared about the possibility of someone seriously hurting themselves or even taking their own life . While it is understandable to have these fears, it is useful to remember that self-harm doesn't necessarily mean that someone wants to end their life. There are, however, a small number of people who do go on to take their own lives, either intentionally or accidentally. It’s therefore important to have an honest conversation with your friend or family member about staying safe – for example, being aware when things are getting too much and knowing when to seek help.

"How does sleep relate to mental health? There's a close relationship between sleep and mental health. Living with a mental health problem can affect how well you sleep, and poor sleep can have a negative impact on your mental health. Poor sleep leads to worrying. Worrying leads to poor sleep. Worrying about sleep is like your mind trying to fight itself. That's a horrible place to be. What problems might I have with sleep? Everyone needs sleep, but many of us have problems with it. You might recognise some of the experiences listed below, or have other difficulties with sleep that aren't mentioned here. You might: find it hard to fall asleep, stay asleep or wake up earlier than you'd like to (also known as insomnia – find out more on the NHS website). have problems that disturb your sleep, such as panic attacks, flashbacks, nightmares or psychosis. find it hard to wake up or get out of bed. often feel tired or sleepy – this could be because you're not sleeping enough, not getting good quality sleep or because of health problems. sleep a lot – which could include sleeping at times when you want, or need, to be awake. When I get depressed, I sleep so much – at its worst it was 18 hours a day, because it was the only way that I could stop thinking and stop my mind from saying awful things to me. If you're having problems sleeping, you might: be more likely to feel anxious, depressed or suicidal. be more likely to have psychotic episodes – poor sleep can trigger mania, psychosis or paranoia, or make existing symptoms worse. feel lonely or isolated – for example, if you don't have the energy to see people or they don't seem to understand. struggle to concentrate, or make plans and decisions. feel irritable or not have energy to do things. have problems with day to day life – for example, at work or with family and friends. be more affected by other health problems, including mental health problems. During the day, my brain is fuzzy, my memory is noticeably affected. I barely have energy to function. What causes problems with sleep? The things that affect our sleep differ for everyone. They can include: stresses or worries – for example, issues with money, housing or work. problems with where you sleep – for example, if you sleep somewhere uncomfortable or you're easily disturbed. health conditions relating to sleep, also known as sleep disorders. being a parent or carer. taking medication, including starting or coming off medication. recreational drugs and alcohol. working at night or being a shift worker. current or past trauma. mental and physical health problems, many of which can affect your sleep. For more information about sleep disorders, see the Mental Health Foundation and Royal College of Psychiatrists websites, and our list of useful contacts . It's not possible to relax if you don't have anywhere comfortable and safe at night. This leads to not sleeping and worrying most of the night. If problems with sleep are worrying you or affecting your day to day life, it's a good idea to see a doctor who can give you a health check and help you access treatment and support. If you fill in a sleep diary , you could take this to your appointment to show your doctor. My sleep problems are [...] more a case of bedtime procrastination than insomnia as such and, as a consequence, being too tired the next morning. I still haven't found out what works for me as I can get to sleep once I do get to bed. How could mental health problems affect my sleep? If you live with a mental health problem, this could affect your sleep in lots of ways. For example: Anxiety can cause racing or repetitive thoughts, and worries that keep you awake. You may also have panic attacks while you're trying to sleep. Depression and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can make you sleep more, including staying in bed for longer or sleeping more often. Depression can also cause insomnia. If you've gone through trauma, this can cause flashbacks, nightmares or night terrors that disturb your sleep. You might feel unsafe or uncomfortable in bed or in the dark. Paranoia and psychosis may make it difficult to sleep. You may hear voices, or see things you find frightening or disturbing. Mania often causes feelings of energy and elation, so you might not feel tired or want to sleep. Racing thoughts can also keep you awake and cause insomnia. Psychiatric medication can cause side effects including insomnia, disturbed sleep, nightmares and oversleeping. Stopping psychiatric drugs can also cause sleep problems. How my sleep pattern highlighted my failing mental health. My sleep was the first red flag that started waving wildly to warn me that something was wrong. Read Rhiannon's story"
"How can I improve my sleep? This page has some tips and suggestions for improving your sleep. Some people find these ideas useful, but remember that different things work for different people at different times. Only try what you feel comfortable with, and try not to put too much pressure on yourself. If something isn't working for you (or doesn't feel possible just now), you can try something else, or come back to it another time. Try to establish a routine add remove It could help to establish a regular sleeping routine or habits. You might need to try different things before you find what works for you. You could try going to bed and waking up at around the same time every day. Or it might help to go to bed only once you feel ready to sleep, but still get up around the same time. I was told to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, but lying in bed, in the dark, for hours and hours ... left me far too distressed to be able to fall asleep. So now I only go to bed when I feel like I will fall asleep within about 15 minutes or so, no matter what time of night that is, and then I try to get up at the same time every day. Relax before you try to sleep add remove You may find a relaxation routine can help you prepare for sleep. These are some ideas you could try. Do something calming For example, this could be listening to relaxing music or having a bath. A nicely made bed helps. If I’m having an awful day, and the only thing I’ve managed to find the energy to do is make my bed, then that’s OK. Breathing exercises See the NHS UK and Mental Health Foundation websites for ones you can try. Another thing that has worked for me is to lay down on my back and rest both my hands on my stomach/chest. Concentrating on my breathing and feeling my natural up and down movement makes me stop overthinking. Muscle relaxation Consciously tense and relax your muscles, one after the other, starting with your toes and working up your body until you reach the top of your head. Visualisation Picture a scene or landscape that has pleasant memories for you, or that you imagine would be a calming or peaceful place to be. Meditation Some people find it helps to try meditation techniques, like mindfulness . You could learn these at a class or from self-help guides. Fill in a sleep diary add remove You may find it difficult to work out what's affecting your sleep. A sleep diary involves recording information about your sleep habits to help you understand your sleep problem and what's affecting it. If you want to, you can show your sleep diary to healthcare professionals to help explain what problems you're having. For example, you could take it with you to a doctor's appointment. A sleep diary could include information about: what time you go to bed and what time you get up. total number of hours of sleep, or a rough idea if you're not sure. overall quality of sleep, ranked 1–5. how many times you wake up in the night, how long you're awake and what you do while you're awake. whether you have nightmares, night terrors or sleep paralysis, or have sleepwalked during the night. whether you sleep during the day and for how long. any medication you're taking, including the dose and what time you take it. the amount of caffeine, alcohol or nicotine you have. the amount of physical activity you do. what you eat and drink. your general feelings and moods, including any anxious or repetitive thoughts. You should keep your sleep diary for at least two weeks. The Sleep Charity has a sleep diary template on its website that you could try. [I] write what's happened, what did or didn't help, anything I need to or scribble to let out anger when the words and the tears are stuck. Try to make your sleeping area more comfortable add remove You might not have much control over where you sleep – for example, if you're staying in hospital or temporary accommodation. But there might still be small changes you can make, or ask someone to help you with. For example: Try different temperature, light and noise levels to see what works for you. Lots of people find dark, quiet and cool environments best, but everyone is different. If you can't sleep in darkness, try keeping a light or bedside lamp switched on. If silence makes it harder to sleep, listen to music, nature sounds, a podcast or the radio. You might find it helpful to try different bedding – for example, a warmer or cooler duvet, or a different pillow. If you're affected by issues with a partner – for example, snoring or problems sharing a bed – the British Snoring & Sleep Apnoea Association has information on its website and a helpline. Sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep I don't like being alone with my thoughts. I have found [podcasts] an amazing comfort because it's a friendly voice just speaking so soothingly and telling a winding bedtime story – it just keeps my mind occupied enough not to start spiralling, and to fall asleep. Think about screens and device settings add remove Using screens in the evening, including on tablets and mobile phones, can negatively affect your sleep. It can help to think about when and how you use screens. For example, you could try: avoiding screens an hour or two before bed. cutting down on screen time before you try to sleep. avoiding stimulating activities, such as playing games. using a blue light filter, night mode or dark mode – you might be able to find these options in your device settings and in individual app settings. adjusting other settings – for example, changing the brightness, or using silent, flight or airplane, or do not disturb mode. Reminding myself that a bad night of sleep won't make or break me (because I can make it through, even if it sucks) has helped a lot to allay stress/anxiety about sleep. Look after yourself add remove Looking after yourself physically can help improve your sleep. Try these to see if they help. Think about your diet Some types of foods can affect your sleep, including caffeine and sugar. It can also help to avoid eating large meals right before going to bed. Our pages on food and mood have more information. Try to do some physical activity Physical activity can help you sleep, including gentle physical activity. It can be particularly helpful to be active outdoors. Some people find they need to stop any physical activity a few hours before going to sleep. Our pages on physical activity and mental health have more information. Spend time outside Being outside in green space can help you relax and improve your wellbeing. Spending time in natural light can also be helpful for your sleep. Our pages on nature and mental health have more information. Music and brisk walking helps me settle down at night because the pace of my thoughts I can match to the pace of my walking – thus it helps settle my mind a little and tires me out before bed. Find support for connected issues add remove If you're experiencing other issues alongside sleep problems, such as money worries or addiction to recreational drugs or alcohol, getting support for these things can help with your sleep problems too. Our pages on money and mental health , addiction and dependency , and mental health effects of drugs and alcohol have information about organisations that can help. Some medication, including psychiatric medication , can affect your sleep. If you're taking any type of medication and having problems with your sleep, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist. Support during the night If you're awake and you need support with difficult feelings or worries, here are some options that are available 24/7.

"What is stress? Stress is how we react when we feel under pressure or threatened. It usually happens when we are in a situation that we don't feel we can manage or control. When we experience stress, it can be as: An individual, for example when you have lots of responsibilities that you are struggling to manage. Part of a group, for example if your family is going through a difficult time, such as bereavement or financial problems. Part of your community, for example if you belong to a religious group that is experiencing discrimination. A member of society, for example during natural disasters or events like the coronavirus pandemic. If you feel stress as part of a bigger group, you may all experience it differently. This can happen even if the cause of your stress is the same. It's overwhelming. Sometimes you can't see beyond the thick fog of stress. When is stress a problem? Sometimes, a small amount of stress can help us to complete tasks and feel more energised. But stress can become a problem when it lasts for a long time or is very intense. In some cases, stress can affect our physical and mental health. You might hear healthcare professionals refer to some types of stress as 'acute' or 'chronic': Acute stress happens within a few minutes to a few hours of an event. It lasts for a short period of time, usually less than a few weeks, and is very intense. It can happen after an upsetting or unexpected event. For example, this could be a sudden bereavement, assault or natural disaster. Chronic stress lasts for a long period of time or keeps coming back. You might experience this if you are under lots of pressure a lot of the time. You might also feel chronic stress if your day-to-day life is difficult, for example if you are a carer or if you live in poverty. I had time off work with stress and anxiety issues. I was on a very slippery slope and getting further down said slope at a rapid speed. I was scared. Is stress a mental health problem? Stress is not normally considered a mental health problem. But it is connected to our mental health in several ways: Stress can cause mental health problems. And it can make existing problems worse. For example, if you experience lots of stress, this might lead you to develop a mental health problem like anxiety or depression. Or a traumatic period of stress might lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mental health problems can cause stress. You might find coping with the day-to-day symptoms of your mental health problem is stressful. You may also feel stressed about managing medication, healthcare appointments or other treatments. You might use recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with stress. This could also affect your mental health, and cause further stress."
"Signs and symptoms of stress. Stress can affect our emotions, our body and how we behave, in lots of different ways. Sometimes when we are stressed, we might be able to tell right away. But at other times, we might keep going without recognising the signs. This page covers some of the common signs and symptoms: How stress can make you feel. Physical signs of stress. How stress can make you behave. It was quite a revelation to notice my frantically beating heart, racing thoughts, hyperactive personality and behaviours all resulted from being massively and permanently stressed out. How stress can make you feel. If you are stressed, you might feel: Irritable, angry, impatient or wound up. Over-burdened or overwhelmed. Anxious, nervous or afraid. Like your thoughts are racing and you can't switch off. Unable to enjoy yourself. Depressed. Uninterested in life. Like you've lost your sense of humour. A sense of dread. Worried or tense. Neglected or lonely. Existing mental health problems getting worse. Some people who go through severe stress may experience suicidal feelings. This can be very distressing. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. Physical signs of stress. The hormones that our bodies produce to respond to stressful situations can have many physical effects. These effects might include: Difficulty breathing. Panic attacks. Blurred eyesight or sore eyes. Sleep problems. Fatigue. Muscle aches and headaches. Chest pains and high blood pressure. Indigestion or heartburn. Constipation or diarrhoea. Feeling sick, dizzy or fainting. Sudden weight gain or weight loss. Developing rashes or itchy skin. Sweating. Changes to your period or menstrual cycle. Existing physical health problems getting worse. If we experience high levels of stress, these physical effects can get worse. This can also happen if we experience stress for a long period of time. In some cases, stress may cause more severe or long-term physical health problems. These might include: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ('broken heart' syndrome). This can feel similar to a heart attack. The British Heart Foundation has information about takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Secondary amenorrhoea. This is when you don't get your period for three months or more. The NHS has information on stopped or missed periods. I started waking up in the morning in a panic, feeling nauseous, with my heart racing. That feeling would stick around for as long as I was awake. 99% of the time, I felt like something really bad was about to happen. How stress can make you behave. If you feel stressed, it might make you: Find it hard to make decisions. Unable to concentrate. Unable to remember things, or make your memory feel slower than usual. Constantly worry or have feelings of dread. Snap at people. Bite your nails. Pick at or itch your skin. Grind your teeth or clench your jaw. Experience sexual problems, such as losing interest in sex or being unable to enjoy sex. Eat too much or too little. Smoke, use recreational drugs or drink alcohol more than you usually would.

[It feels like] the world is closing in on me, I can't breathe and I'm running out of time."
"What causes stress? Many things can cause stress. You might feel stressed because of one big event or situation in your life. Or it might be a build-up of lots of smaller things. This might make it harder for you to identify what's making you feel stressed, or to explain it to other people. You may experience stress if you: Feel under lots of pressure. Face big changes in your life. Are worried about something. Don't have much or any control over the outcome of a situation. Have responsibilities that you find overwhelming. Don't have enough work, activities or change in your life. Experience discrimination, hate or abuse. Are going through a period of uncertainty. Stressful life events, which in isolation might seem less significant, combined to have a real impact on my mental health. Why do certain things make me feel stressed? How stressed you feel in different situations may depend on factors like: How comfortable you feel in certain types of situation. What else you are going through at the time. Your past experiences, and how these affect the way you feel about yourself. The resources you have available to you, such as time and money. The amount of support you have from other people. Some situations that don't bother you at all might cause someone else a lot of stress. This is because we are all influenced by different experiences. We also have different levels of support and ways of coping. Certain events might also make you feel stressed sometimes, but not every time. For example, if you go shopping for food with enough time and money, you may not feel stressed. But you might feel stressed if you have lots of other things to do, have a tight budget, or need to buy food for a big event. I get stressed when things get out of perspective – too much work, thinking too far ahead. What kind of situations can cause stress? Many things can cause stress in different areas of our lives. These may include: Personal Illness or injury. Pregnancy and becoming a parent. Infertility and problems having children. Bereavement. Experiencing abuse. Experiencing crime and the justice system, such as being arrested, going to court or being a witness. Organising a complicated event, like a holiday. Everyday tasks, such as household chores or taking transport. Friends and family Getting married or civil partnered. Going through a break-up or getting divorced. Difficult relationships with parents, siblings, friends or children. Being a carer. My breakdown [...] was due to having a stressful job as a project manager and dealing with a marriage break up and subsequent divorce. Employment and study Losing your job. Long-term unemployment. Retiring. Exams and deadlines. Difficult situations or colleagues at work. Starting a new job. Housing Housing problems, such as poor living conditions, lack of security or homelessness. Moving house. Problems with neighbours. Money Worries about money or benefits. Living in poverty. Managing debt. Social factors Having poor access to services such as medical care, green spaces or transport. Living through a stressful community-wide, national or global event, like the coronavirus pandemic. Experiencing stigma or discrimination, including racism, homophobia, biphobia or transphobia. Can happy events cause stress? Some of these situations are often thought of as happy events. For example, you might feel expected to be happy or excited about getting married or having a baby. But these events can bring big changes, and you might experience new or unusual demands. So they can still feel very stressful. This can be difficult to deal with, especially if you also feel pressure to be positive. I've never been more stressed in my life than the 6 months leading up to my wedding... everyone kept asking me if I was happy and expecting me to be excited all the time, but I just couldn't feel it. I ended up getting really ill."
"Managing stress and building resilience. Being prepared for periods of stress can make it easier to get through them. And knowing how to manage our wellbeing can help us recover after a stressful event. Some of us may refer to our ability to manage stress as our resilience. There are things we can try to build our resilience against stress. But there are also factors that might make it harder to be resilient, such as experiencing discrimination or lacking support. This page has information on: Barriers to resilience. Tips for managing stress. Barriers to resilience. The terms 'resilience' and 'managing stress' can mean different things to different people. We might understand them differently because our experiences shape how we feel stress, and how easily we can respond to it. Some people may think that our response to stress is something that we can all easily control. But this is not true. There are some causes of stress that are beyond our control. And some ways of managing stress and building resilience are not always available to us. This makes dealing with stress very personal – it may be harder for some of us than for others. Some experiences that can make it more difficult include: Having a long-term physical health condition. Having a mental health problem. Experiencing discrimination and hate, including racism, homophobia, biphobia or transphobia. Living far away from family or friends, or having difficult relationships with them. Experiencing loneliness. Experiencing poverty and money worries, including debt or problems with benefits. Living in an area with poor access to services like healthcare, public transport and green spaces. Being a single parent. Being a carer. Having poor quality housing. Lacking safety and protection, such as living in areas with poor policing. Research shows that it is easier to develop resilience if we don't face these barriers. But many of these things are difficult or impossible to change. Remember : if you face these barriers, this is not your fault. And it is not up to you to remove these barriers yourself. I believe that the root cause of my anxiety and stress was racism. This was further exacerbated by experiencing microaggressions at school and university. Tips for managing stress. Below are some tips you could try to help you manage stress and build your resilience. Trying these ideas won't make all the stress in your life disappear. But they could make it easier to get through stressful situations. Look after your wellbeing Taking care of your wellbeing can help you feel more able to manage stress. Different things will work for different people, but these are some ideas you could try: Be kind to yourself. Learning to be kinder to yourself can help with how you feel in different situations. Try to take breaks in your day for things you enjoy. And reward yourself for your achievements, even if they seem small. Try to find time to relax. This might feel hard if you can't do anything to stop a situation that is making you stressed. But if you can allow yourself a short break, this can help with how you feel.  Develop your interests and hobbies. Spending time on things you enjoy could help distract you from a stressful situation. If stress is making you feel lonely or isolated, shared hobbies can also be a good way to meet new people. Spend time in nature. This can help to reduce stress and improve wellbeing. You could try going for a walk in a green space, taking care of indoor plants, or spending time with animals. Our nature and mental health pages have more information. Look after your physical health. Getting enough sleep, staying physically active and eating a balanced diet can make stress easier to manage. Stress can sometimes make these things difficult to look after. But even small changes can make a big difference.  Mental health apps. There are various apps available that you could use to help yourself day-to-day. But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. Would you like some recommendations? We've put together a library of safe apps that meet our high quality standards. My advice would be if you’re feeling stressed, be kind to yourself, everything starts with you. Build your support network Research shows that having a good support network can help to build resilience and make stress easier to manage. Support from people you trust can make stressful situations easier to manage. This support could include: Friends and family. Sometimes telling the people close to you how you're feeling can make a big difference. They might be able to help with some of the things causing you stress. Support at work. For example, this may be from your manager, human resources (HR) department, union representatives or employee assistance scheme. Your wellbeing is important and responsible employers should take it seriously. If you're worried that your workplace might not be supportive, our page on work and stress has some guidance that may help. The Health and Safety Executive has information on work-related stress that may also help. Support at university or college. For example, this could be from your tutors, student union or student services.  Peer support. If you're finding things hard, talking to people who have similar feelings or experiences can help. This could be face-to-face at a peer support group, or through an online community like Mind's Side by Side.  The brain is like an engine; if you run it too hot all day, every day without checking the oil and water, it breaks. Identify your triggers Working out what may trigger stress can help you prepare for it. Even if you can't avoid these situations, being prepared can help. Knowing what you can and cannot change could help you work out the best way to deal with stress. Take some time to think about situations that might make you feel stressed. You could do this on your own or with someone you trust. You could consider: Situations that come up often and that you worry about, such as paying a bill or attending an appointment. One-off events that are on your mind a lot, like moving house or taking an exam. Ongoing stressful events, like being a carer or experiencing discrimination. Something that you are worried about happening again, such as going back to a place that you had a bad experience. Reflecting on these things may sometimes be upsetting. If remembering or talking about these experiences makes you feel worse, you can stop. Our pages on trauma have more information on stressful or frightening events that may be difficult to talk about. I think it’s very important to acknowledge your feelings. Be honest with how you’re feeling. If you’re not happy in any situation, it’s okay to leave. It’s also okay to ask for help. Organise your time Some of us may feel stressed because we have a lot of things to manage in our lives. In this case, changing the way we organise our time can help us feel more in control. If you think this may help, you could: Try to identify when you have the most energy, such as in the morning or in the evening. If you can, do your most important tasks around that time of day, to help you concentrate better. Make a list of things you have to do. Arrange them in order of importance. Try to focus on the most urgent thing first. You might find it helpful to create a timetable, planning when to spend time on each task. Set smaller, achievable targets. When we feel stressed, it's easy to set ourselves large or unrealistic goals. This might be to try to overcome the situation that is making us feel stressed. But often, this can make us feel more stressed and frustrated, if we don't reach the targets we set. Setting smaller, more achievable goals can help us feel more satisfied and in control. Vary your activities. Try to balance boring tasks with more interesting ones. And mix up stressful tasks with those you find easier, or that you can do more calmly. Try not to do too much at once. If you take on too much, you might find it harder to do any individual task well. This could make you feel even more stressed. Be clear with others about what you can take on. In some situations, it might not always be possible to say no to things, or tell people exactly how you feel. But if you can, let people know if their demands are unreasonable or unrealistic. Have breaks and take things slowly. It might be difficult to do this when you're stressed. But it can help to deal with things better and get through a stressful situation. Ask someone if they can help. For example, you could ask a friend or family member to help with some of your daily tasks. This can give you more time to spend on any tasks that are making you stressed. I need to take on enough challenges to keep me interested and engaged with the world, but not too many to the point where I am exhausted. Take action in your community Sometimes, our stress might be caused or made worse by problems in our community, such as lack of access to services. Taking action against these problems can help how we feel in ourselves, as well as supporting others. When we are very stressed, these things might not feel possible. And at any time, they might feel tiring or stressful themselves. But if you feel able to do so, some things you could try include: Mind campaigns. Visit our campaigns page to find out how we are campaigning for change, and how to become a campaigner. Community groups. There might be campaigns or volunteering projects to improve your local area and community. Do IT has information on volunteer groups in your area.

It can feel difficult if someone you're close to is feeling stressed. You might find it hard if you can't help them change the situation that is causing them stress. But there are still lots of practical things you can do to help. Help them notice signs and symptoms of stress. Often, someone might not notice that how they feel or behave is a sign of stress . For example, this may include having problems sleeping, or drinking more alcohol than usual. You may be able to see these signs in someone else. This could even be before they recognise it themselves. If you've noticed this, you could let them know and ask how you can help. Try to be gentle when starting this conversation, in case it is something they are not aware of or feel sensitive about. Listen to how they feel. Having a chance to talk could help them feel calmer and more able to deal with their stress. Being there for them and listening without judging them can help. [My friends can help by] making me a cup of tea, holding me while I cry, making me laugh... Reassure them. When someone is in the middle of a stressful time, it can be hard to see when it might end. Let them know that situations change and can get better. Help them relax. You could help them research relaxation techniques and find ways to practise them. For example, this could be a weekly yoga class, or setting aside time for breathing exercises at home. This might become something that you could do together. [When I'm stressed I need friends to] hug me. It's amazing how good a single hug can feel. Help identify their triggers. It may help to talk about things you've noticed that might trigger their stress. But remember that they might also find this conversation stressful. Try to stay open-minded and avoid judging them. Being patient can also help. Not putting extra pressure on me... letting me know they're there but that I don't have to do anything. Help with causes of stress. There are many situations or experiences that can cause stress. You might be able to help them look for support for some of these issues.

"What are suicidal feelings? Suicide is the act of intentionally taking your own life. Suicidal feelings can mean having abstract thoughts about ending your life or feeling that people would be better off without you. Or it can mean thinking about methods of suicide or making clear plans to take your own life. If you are feeling suicidal, you might be scared or confused by these feelings. You may find the feelings overwhelming. But you are not alone. Many people think about suicide at some point in their lifetime. I couldn't see past the pain. It was a different reality for me. I only knew I wanted the pain to stop, the anguish to go away. What does it feel like to be suicidal? Different people have different experiences of suicidal feelings. You might feel unable to cope with the difficult feelings you are experiencing. You may feel less like you want to die and more like you cannot go on living the life you have. These feelings may build over time or might change from moment to moment. And it's common to not understand why you feel this way. How you might think or feel hopeless, like there is no point in living. tearful and overwhelmed by negative thoughts. unbearable pain that you can't imagine ending. useless, not wanted or not needed by others. desperate, as if you have no other choice. like everyone would be better off without you. cut off from your body or physically numb. fascinated by death. What you may experience poor sleep, including waking up earlier than you want to. a change in appetite, weight gain or loss. no desire to take care of yourself, for example neglecting your physical appearance. wanting to avoid others. making a will or giving away possessions. struggling to communicate. self-loathing and low self-esteem. urges to self-harm. Suicidal thoughts aren't permanent – things do improve. You can find your motivation to live again. How long will I feel suicidal? How long suicidal feelings last is different for everyone. It is common to feel as if you'll never be happy or hopeful again. But with treatment and support , including self-care , the majority of people who have felt suicidal go on to live fulfilling lives. The earlier you let someone know how you're feeling, the quicker you'll be able to get support to overcome these feelings. But it can feel difficult to open up to people. You may want others to understand what you're going through, but you might feel: unable to tell someone. unsure of who to tell. concerned that they won't understand. fearful of being judged. worried you'll upset them. If you feel like this, you might find it helpful to show our pages on supporting someone else with suicidal feelings to someone you trust. This can be a good way of starting the conversation and can give them suggestions of how they can help you. It's important to remember that you deserve support, you are not alone and there is support out there. Sharing that I felt suicidal with close friends, although scary as I worried they'd be angry, has helped me in subsequent black times. They said they'd hate to lose me having not been given the chance to help."
"Why do I feel suicidal? Suicidal feelings can affect anyone, of any age, gender or background, at any time. If you are feeling suicidal it is likely that you have felt increasingly hopeless and worthless for some time. You may not know what has caused you to feel this way but it is often a combination of factors. This page covers: Common causes of suicidal feelings. Can medication cause suicidal feelings? If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. The thoughts would completely consume you sometimes, feeling like you have no control over your own body. Common causes of suicidal feelings. Struggling to cope with certain difficulties in your life can cause you to feel suicidal. These difficulties may include: Mental health problems. Bullying, prejudice or stigma, such as relating to your race, gender, disability or sexual identity. Different types of abuse, including domestic, sexual or physical abuse.

But whatever the reason, there is support available to help you cope and overcome these feelings. Whenever I feel suicidal thoughts starting to engulf me I keep reminding myself that feelings can change in an instant. Perhaps I'll wake up tomorrow and will no longer feel like I want to die – because that has happened many times before. Can medication cause suicidal feelings? Some medications, such as antidepressants , can cause some people to experience suicidal feelings. This side effect is often associated with a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). But all antidepressants have this as a possible risk. Some research shows that young people under the age of 25 are more likely to experience suicidal feelings when taking these medications. Some antipsychotic medications and mood stabilisers also cause some people to experience suicidal feelings.

"How can I cope right now? If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. You might be feeling so upset, angry and in pain that you believe these feelings will never end. But it's important to remember that they cannot and will not last. Like all feelings, these ones will pass. There are steps you can take right now to stop yourself from acting on your suicidal thoughts. Everyone is different, so it's about finding what works best for you. These are some practical tips that other people have found helpful when they've felt suicidal. Get safe right now add remove Get through the next five minutes Taking things minute by minute can help make things more bearable. Reward yourself each time five minutes have passed. Use our 'I need urgent help' tool for practical ideas to help you through the next few minutes. Remove anything you could use to harm yourself Remove any items or things you could use to harm yourself , or ask someone else to remove these for you. If you're in an unsafe location, move away to somewhere safer. Follow your safety plan or crisis plan If you have a safety plan or crisis plan in place, follow it. These plans are a good way to save ideas for helping yourself when you feel unwell. Tell someone how you're feeling Whether it's a friend, family member or even a pet, telling someone else how you're feeling can help you feel less alone and more in control. When it got really bad and the temptation to harm myself was really bad I would get my family to hide dangerous things away and go to bed. Distract yourself add remove Try self-harm coping techniques If you're thinking of harming yourself, you could try using self-harm coping techniques. For example, you could: hold an ice cube in your hand until it melts and focus on how cold it feels. tear something up into hundreds of pieces. take a very cold shower or bath.  Focus on your senses Taking time to think about what you can smell, taste, touch, hear and see can help to ground your thoughts. Steady your breathing Take long, deep breaths. Breathing out for longer than you breathe in can help you feel calmer. Look after your needs If you can, try doing the following: get a glass of water. eat something if you're hungry. sit somewhere comfortable. write down how you're feeling. Try to avoid drinking alcohol or taking recreational drugs, as this can make you feel worse. Go outside If you're feeling numb, go outside and feel the rain, sun or wind against your skin. This can help you to feel more connected to your body. Contact a helpline or listening service If you can't talk to someone you know, call a helpline or listening service . For example, you could call Samaritans on 116 123 if you want to talk to somebody about how you're feeling at any time. Or if you'd prefer not to talk over the phone, you could try a text service such as Shout's crisis text service – text SHOUT to 85258 . Use online peer support You could try using online peer support to talk about how you're feeling. For example, you could try Side by Side , Mind's supportive online community. Sometimes it's just about survival and focusing on something that's real until the feelings can become easier to deal with. Challenge your thoughts add remove Make a deal with yourself that you won't act today Plan to get support if you're not getting support already.  Find your reasons to live You may feel like the world will be better off without you or there's no point in living, but this is never the case. You could try the following: Write down what you're looking forward to. This could be eating your favourite meal, seeing a loved one or catching up on the next episode of a TV show. Make plans to do something you enjoy tomorrow or in the near future. Plans don't have to be big or expensive. Think about the people you love. No matter how bad you're feeling, it's important to remember that these people would miss you. Be kind to yourself Talk to yourself as if you were talking to a good friend. And try doing something nice for yourself. This could be something small like having a bath, wrapping yourself in a blanket and watching your favourite film. These ideas may seem silly but it can be easy to forget to do something nice for yourself. Tell yourself you can get through this At times, we can concentrate on the negative things we tell ourselves and lose hope. Repeating to yourself that you can get past these feelings can help you regain hope and focus on getting through it. Rather than focus on all the desperate negative thoughts about being a burden and of no use, bring your focus into trying to believe it will not last forever and working out how you can safely get through."
"How can I cope in the future? If you have experienced suicidal feelings in the past, you may be worried that these feelings might return.

Try to make a plan when you can think clearly about what you would find helpful. You might want to complete the plan with someone you trust, such as a friend or therapist. You could also give them a copy of the plan to keep. I tried to plan for feeling really bad, knowing that I could become incapable of controlling my feelings for a while. It hurts to not trust yourself but it does pass and I am so glad to be here still. Is a safety plan the same as a crisis plan? A safety plan focuses on what you can do now to keep yourself safe. A crisis plan also focuses on what has helped to keep you safe in the past, but is more detailed. It covers what treatment you would like to receive if necessary, and whether you've made an advance statement or decision . Learn to manage difficult feelings add remove Take each day at a time There might be good days and bad days. Try to focus on each day at a time and set yourself small, achievable goals.

If someone compliments you, make a note of it. Do things just for yourself Try to regularly make time for things you like to do. You could spend half an hour reading a book, or doing a hobby you enjoy. Or you could take the chance to try out something new. Connect with other people add remove Seek support  These support options may help if you don't currently receive any support and want to start. But they also help if the support you currently receive doesn't feel right for you and you want to try something different. Let others know how you're feeling Tell people what you find helpful and let them know when you're finding things difficult. It's okay to ask others to be with you if you need them.

If you are having trouble sleeping, see our pages on sleep problems for tips to help you cope. Try to avoid recreational drugs and alcohol You might find that you want to use recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings about yourself. But in the long run they can make you feel worse and can prevent you from dealing with any underlying problems.  Think about your diet Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels.  Try to do some physical activity Many people find exercise a challenge but activities like yoga, swimming or walking can be a big boost to your mood.

"About tardive dyskinesia. This page covers: What is tardive dyskinesia? Tardive dyskinesia as a side effect​. Finding help and support​​. What is tardive dyskinesia? Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a condition where your face, body or both make sudden, irregular movements which you cannot control. It can develop as a side effect of medication, most commonly antipsychotic drugs . Tardive means delayed or appearing late – TD usually develops after you've been taking medication for a few months, or sometimes years. Dyskinesia means abnormal or unusual movements. It started with uncontrollably blinking and stretching my nose/top lip. I remember myself and my close family being quite confused as to why I was doing it! Experiencing signs and symptoms of TD can make it hard to do day-to-day activities. It can also be very stressful or upsetting. For example, you may feel: self-conscious about movements caused by TD. upset that you cannot control what your body is doing. uncomfortable and restless. tired or worn out if the movements happen a lot. angry, particularly if you didn't know about TD as a side effect of medication. that it's very hard or impossible to predict when you'll experience symptoms. Having TD has made me very socially anxious and shy. I am constantly aware of my twitches and I wonder if people notice and, if so, what they are thinking... Tardive dyskinesia as a side effect. Awareness of TD has improved, but unfortunately doctors don't always remember to tell people about this risk when prescribing antipsychotics. Doctors don't always have to tell you about every side effect. These are listed in the patient information leaflet (PIL) you get with medication too. If your health condition is severe, your doctor may also think that the treatment is necessary, no matter the side effect. There are also some situations where you can be given medication without your consent . Can I make a complaint if I get tardive dyskinesia? If you begin to develop TD and your doctor does nothing about it, or doesn't spot the signs, this may be considered clinical negligence . This means a healthcare professional has failed in their duty to take care of you, and you experienced damage or loss as a result of that failure. For more information about complaints, see our page on complaining about healthcare . You can also contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) . This NHS service gives confidential, impartial advice on problems experienced in NHS healthcare. For more information about what your doctor should do before giving you medication, see our page on psychiatric medication . I had a year-long psychosis as a teenager. Treating the psychosis was utterly prioritised – the side effects of the medication were not properly explained to me or my family as far as I can remember. Finding help and support. If you're taking any medication and think you might be experiencing TD, it's important to speak to a doctor or pharmacist for advice . To speak to someone right away, you can contact the NHS by calling 111. You can also report side effects to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) through its Yellow Card Scheme ."
"Tardive dyskinesia signs and symptoms. This page covers: What are the signs of tardive dyskinesia? What symptoms can tardive dyskinesia cause? Similar conditions and diagnoses. What are the signs of tardive dyskinesia? The main sign of tardive dyskinesia (TD) is making movements which: you do not normally make. are totally out of your control. Normally, the first sign of TD is irregular tongue movements. These might be very small and you might not even notice them at first. I first experienced finger and small muscle twitches and spasms which gradually got worse. What symptoms can tardive dyskinesia cause? Some people have mild symptoms that they hardly notice, while others might find symptoms severely impact their day-to-day life. How much the symptoms of TD affect you can change over time. It may cause the following symptoms in your face or body, or both. Jerky movements These are irregular movements which are not rhythmic. For example: lip smacking. moving your mouth, jaw or tongue. tapping or moving your hands or feet. movement in your hips. movement in your upper body. blinking your eyes a lot. puffing out your cheeks. making noises or facial expressions you cannot control. Slow movements These are slow and flowing movements. For example: writhing or squirming. wiggling or twisting your fingers, arms, legs, neck or tongue. Muscle spasms These are movements where your muscles suddenly tighten. They might last for a short time or longer periods. For example: making grunting noises. having difficulty breathing or swallowing. changes to your posture. You might also hear this called tardive dystonia . For more information, you can visit the Dystonia Society website . I had neck stiffness for two weeks and then developed a twitch in my right arm. This quickly developed into both arms cramping regularly. My arm would cramp and spasm and my thumb would end up touching my shoulder. It's really important to notice signs and symptoms early, as this can reduce the chance of TD becoming more severe. If you're taking antipsychotic drugs and experiencing any of these signs, speak to a doctor as soon as possible – even if the symptoms seem mild, or you're not sure what they are. ​​Similar conditions and diagnoses. The symptoms of TD are similar to some other physical health conditions that can develop in adults. It's important to rule out these conditions so you can get the right treatment. These conditions include: Huntington's Disease. Parkinson's Disease. Tourette's Syndrome. If you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia , you may have experienced unusual movements before taking any medication. This may include moving your legs and arms a lot or being restless. This might make it hard to recognise or pick out the symptoms of TD."
"Causes of tardive dyskinesia. This page covers: What causes tardive dyskinesia? Risk factors in developing tardive dyskinesia. What causes tardive dyskinesia? Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a side effect of medication, most commonly from antipsychotic drugs . These drugs may be part of your treatment if you have a diagnosis of: psychosis. schizophrenia. bipolar disorder. severe depression or anxiety, though this is less common. severe nausea, vomiting or migraines, though this is less common. TD can also be a side effect of other drugs used for treating physical conditions. It is thought that TD develops because of the way these medications change levels of the chemical dopamine in your brain . Risk factors in developing tardive dyskinesia. Anyone taking antipsychotic drugs is at risk of developing TD. It's listed as a common or very common side effect for antipsychotic medication. All drugs affect people differently, so it's not possible to tell whether you will get a particular side effect. But the main risk factors are: How long you have been taking antipsychotic medication. The longer you are on medication, the greater the risk that you might develop TD. What dose you are on. Taking a higher dose makes developing TD more likely. Which antipsychotic you take. Older antipsychotics – known as first-generation – are particularly associated with causing TD. Newer antipsychotics – known as second-generation – were developed with the aim of reducing side effects like TD, but can still cause it. Although medical professionals think newer drugs are less likely to cause TD, the difference is still unclear. Once you have TD, stopping and starting antipsychotics can also increase the risk of it becoming more severe. It's very important to talk to a doctor before deciding to come off medication . It is also possible to develop TD after you stop taking medication. Some research suggests that you may be more likely to develop TD if you: are over the age of 50. are female. are post-menopause. are Black. have a drug or alcohol addiction. have diabetes. have a learning disability. have a brain injury. The risk may be greater if more than one of these applies to you. For more information about antipsychotics, side effects and what to know before starting medication, see our pages on psychiatric medication and antipsychotics . Parkinson's symptoms and drugs Antipsychotics – particularly older, first-generation ones – can also cause other side effects that affect your movement. For example: symptoms that mimic Parkinson's disease, such as shaking, stiffness, slow movements and restless legs – also called Parkinsonism. akathisia, which means extreme restlessness. If you develop either of these side effects, you may be more likely to develop TD. You're also likely to be offered anti-Parkinson's drugs to help control these symptoms. However, anti-Parkinson's drugs themselves are also associated with the development of TD. You should only be offered anti-Parkinson's drugs if: you have already developed Parkinsonism as a side effect of your antipsychotic medication. the symptoms are very troublesome. For more information on anti-Parkinson's drugs and their side effects, see our page on anti-Parkinson's drugs , or visit Parkinson's UK ."
"Treating and managing tardive dyskinesia. This page covers: Changing or coming off your medication. Additional drugs and treatments for tardive dyskinesia. Managing your day-to-day tasks. If you think you might be experiencing signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), it's really important to seek help as soon as possible . This will give you the best chance of reducing its impact on your day-to-day life. Changing or coming off your medication. As antipsychotic medication is one of the main causes of TD , making changes or coming off this medication can help some people. Different things work for different people, so coming off medication entirely might not be an option for everyone. What will work, or what you want to try, is completely up to you. Changing medication If you've found an antipsychotic that helps you manage your mental health problem, you may not want to stop taking it. This can be a difficult decision, especially if you feel unsure about what will help you the most in the long term. Before you decide to stop taking medication, you and your healthcare professional may consider changing medication instead. You might be able to: take a lower dose of medication. change your medication, particularly from a first-generation to a second-generation antipsychotic. Your doctor should then monitor how you're getting on and whether any changes are regularly affecting you. There is no single medication that works best for everyone – we all respond to them differently. It might take some trial and error to find out what medication works best for you. Over a period of a couple of years my psychiatrist made medication changes and the symptoms eventually abated. I know I run the risk of them returning as I still am on quite a lot of medication. Coming off medication If you identify the signs of TD early and are able to stop or change your medication, it might eventually go away completely. However, this doesn't happen for everyone and could take a long time. For some people, TD may never go away, even after stopping or changing medication. It's also important to remember: It's possible that you may only get TD when you start to come off antipsychotics. In this case, you may decide to stay on your medication. Sometimes, withdrawal can cause involuntary muscle movements or movement disorders that look like TD, but this often gets better with time. The longer you've been taking a drug, the more likely you are to feel withdrawal effects, and find it harder to come off. You may need to reduce your dose very gradually to minimise these effects. For more information, see our pages on coming off medication. Thankfully I saw an understanding GP who took me off the antipsychotic and contacted my psychiatrist to change me to another more suitable medication. Deciding whether to come off medication If changing your medication doesn't work for you, you might consider coming off medication altogether. You might want to think about these questions before doing this: How does TD affect you and your day-to-day life? How does your medication help you and your day-to-day life? Do you experience other unwanted side effects from your medication, as well as TD? How likely are you to relapse if you come off your medication entirely? Talk these over with your healthcare professional. They may have suggestions to help you cope with or minimise problems. For example: coming off anti-Parkinson's drugs may reduce the risk of getting TD, if you're taking these in the first place. learning self-care tips to help you better cope with your symptoms. Remember: If you decide to come off your medication, it is important to do it safely. For information on how to do this and where to get support, see our pages on coming off medication . For more details about withdrawal from these drugs, see our pages on antipsychotics . I gradually stepped down my antipsychotics over two months using diazepam to help with the muscle pain/spasm and mindfulness to help focus my moods and anxiety. Additional drugs and treatments for tardive dyskinesia. Some research suggests that the following treatments could help you manage symptoms of TD: Drugs on prescription In the UK, there are not many approved treatments for TD. But trials are being carried out on certain medications that already have approval in other countries. At the moment, the only drug licensed for treating TD is tetrabenazine . It's a drug used to treat movement disorders. However, common side effects of this drug include Parkinsonism , anxiety and depression , so you may want to think carefully before considering this option. Medical procedures Some researchers are looking into treating TD through the use of: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). botulinum toxin, which is also called Botox. However, studies have not yet been able to confirm if these treatments are safe for TD, or whether they work. DBS is sometimes used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's , and Botox for symptoms of dystonia . Over-the-counter supplements Studies suggest that some supplements or herbal medicines which you can buy over the counter – meaning without a prescription – may help with TD. However, more research is needed to be sure. Some of these supplements include: Vitamin E – a supplement that may help to stop TD from getting worse, but has not been shown to stop the condition entirely. Vitamin B 6 – a supplement that might help with TD. Ginkgo biloba – a herbal medicine that might help with TD. It's important to talk to a doctor or pharmacist before taking any new medication . This includes over-the-counter drugs, as some drugs could interact badly with each other. It's also important to always follow the instructions on the packet or patient information leaflet.  Managing your day-to-day tasks. Changing medication or getting other treatments might not work for everyone. Sometimes, it means that TD may be a condition you have to learn to live with. Some people with TD find that it impacts their life significantly, but others might not. Some symptoms might impact your ability to: eat, drink or prepare food easily. carry items. write with a pen, pencil, or use a smartphone. get around by yourself – if you normally drive, you might need to tell the DVLA if you're no longer fit to drive. If your symptoms are having this kind of impact on your life, your TD might be considered a disability under the Equality Act 2010 . This means you may be eligible for additional help, such as: a blue badge if you drive – for more information on this, visit the Parkinson's UK website. grants or loans to make your home accessible. benefits to help with your financial needs. reasonable adjustments at work, in education, or when using services – for more information on what you might be eligible for, see our legal page on reasonable adjustments. ""It made me feel stupid and very depressed. It was funny sometimes, however it soon became painful. I didn't want to go outside as I felt embarrassed. Disability discrimination Some people experience discrimination due to TD. This can include being treated differently in situations such as: job interviews. the workplace. being a customer in a restaurant or shop. This kind of discrimination is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010 . For more information, see our pages on discrimination ."
"Coping with tardive dyskinesia. Living with tardive dyskinesia (TD) can be really difficult.

For example, try talking to people who have also experienced TD or have taken the same medication. For more information, see our pages on peer support. My 'gurning' has become a bit of a joke in the family and although not everyone can, I find it helps to just laugh about it! Although this doesn't help with the physical pain it helps with the anxiety TD brings. Look after your physical health. Looking after your physical health can reduce stress . As well as this, some people find it can also make TD easier to manage. Try to: get enough sleep. do some physical activity. spend time in nature. These factors can all help your physical health. They are also beneficial to your mental health in general. For more information on looking after your physical health, see our information on everyday living . My wife massaged my neck and arms after the episodes to help with the discomfort. Adapt activities and tasks. Some people with TD find that the symptoms make certain tasks very difficult to manage. These are some adaptations which may help with daily activities and tasks: Plan ahead for activities that you might need more time to do, or need someone to help you with. Get specialist tools for eating, drinking and cooking. A list of equipment that some people find useful is available on the Parkinson's UK website. Try voice activation and dictation if you have a smartphone or tablet. These features allow you to use your device without needing to press buttons on the screen. Use pens or pencils with a thick or padded grip, which can be really helpful when writing. Take a trolley when shopping, or considering shopping online and getting it delivered, if available. Talk to your bank about ways you can make signatures easier if you find writing difficult. This could include using photo ID, changing your signature, or using telephone and online banking. Swap to electrical appliances such as an electric razor for shaving, or an electric toothbrush for cleaning your teeth.

You could try contacting a specialist organisation for support for your symptoms, or your diagnosis. You might also find it useful to connect with others who have experienced TD. Depending on what sort of support you find useful, you could contact: The Dystonia Society.

They also reminded me that I've got through bouts of illness before and that I would get through them again! Try not to judge them. It can be really difficult watching someone you love develop TD, but it's important to remember that they aren't choosing to have these symptoms. They may not realise when they are happening. Try to stay calm and supportive – this can be really helpful if your friend or family member is feeling upset. Help them to continue having a social life. If your friend or family member is feeling distressed or embarrassed, they may need encouragement to keep up with social activities. You could try asking them what sorts of activities they'd like to do, inviting them to family or social events, or helping them to pursue hobbies they enjoy. Be sensitive. If your friend or family member is experiencing TD, they may feel very self-conscious or worried that people are looking at them. Try not to focus on their symptoms or draw unnecessary attention to them. The exceptions are helping them make sense of their symptoms, or making them aware of any changes you've noticed. I would say show empathy each and every step. General non-judgmental, positive support and understanding that you are not mad is a big help."

"What is trauma? Trauma is when we experience very stressful, frightening or distressing events that are difficult to cope with or out of our control. It could be one incident, or an ongoing event that happens over a long period of time. Most of us will experience an event in our lives that could be considered traumatic. But we won't all be affected the same way. Trauma can happen at any age. And it can affect us at any time, including a long time after the event has happened. On this page we explore: What experiences might be traumatic? Types of trauma. If you've been affected by trauma, it's important to remember that you survived however you could. You're having common, normal reactions. Find out more on our page on the effects of trauma . It's ok to ask for help at any time. Even if you're not sure if you've experienced trauma or want to describe your experience that way. I no longer need to physically or emotionally mask my pain anymore. I survived it, I’m still here, I made it through and I feel stronger and more empowered for it. What experiences might be traumatic? There's no rule about what experiences can be traumatic. It's more about how you react to them. What's traumatic is personal. Other people can't know how you feel about your own experiences or if they're traumatic for you. You might have similar experiences to someone else, but be affected differently or for longer. Trauma can include events where you feel: Frightened. Under threat. Humiliated. Rejected. Abandoned. Invalidated, for example your feelings or views have been dismissed or denied. Unsafe. Unsupported. Trapped. Ashamed. Powerless. Ways trauma can happen include: One-off or ongoing events. Being directly harmed or neglected. Witnessing harm to someone else. Living in a traumatic atmosphere. Being affected by trauma in a family or community, including trauma that has happened before you were born. Some groups are more likely to experience trauma than others, and experience it more often. They include: People of colour. People who have served or who are serving in the military. People who are in prison or have been in prison in the past. Refugees and asylum seekers. LGBTQIA+ people. People experiencing poverty. For those of us who belong to these groups, we may find it harder to overcome trauma. This can be because there is a lack of support available or because of stigma and discrimination. Our pages on LGBTQIA+ mental health and racism and mental health have information that may help. I am still traumatised by the words the police officers uttered to me in those moments. The murder of George Floyd made it all hit home. The protests exhibited the pain and frustration built up after so many similar cases where people of colour had been killed while being stopped by the police. Types of trauma. Many experiences can be traumatic. And we all experience trauma in unique ways. But some experiences or events that lead to trauma are sometimes grouped together and given a name. These terms normally describe how trauma affects people from certain groups, or in specific situations. This section explains some of these terms: Childhood trauma You may have experienced trauma during your childhood. These experiences could make you more likely to have mental health problems as an adult. This is especially if you didn't have support to manage the trauma. Or if you experienced trauma continuously, over a long period of time. My high functioning depression and anxiety is a result of childhood trauma that lay dormant from age 13 until it [was] triggered when I was 39. Collective trauma Collective trauma is when a traumatic event happens to a large number of people at the same time. This doesn't mean that everyone who experienced the event feels the same way about it. Or that they all feel it was traumatic for them. Everyone still copes with it in their own way. Experiencing collective trauma can mean you experience personal symptoms and 'social symptoms'. Social symptoms can include how society has dealt with or reacted to the trauma. For example: If it isn't socially acceptable to talk about the event, or only being able to talk about it in certain ways. If people avoid or discriminate against certain groups that might be unfairly blamed for the trauma. The anniversaries of a collective trauma might lead to events such as memorials and media coverage. You might find these events comforting ways of managing collective trauma. Or you may find them very difficult. How you feel about these anniversaries can also change over time. Our information on coping with distressing events in the news might help if you're struggling with media coverage of trauma. Covid-19 has destroyed and remoulded me into someone I am still trying to figure out. It has completely changed my outlook on life and it has broken a part of me which I am still working hard to heal, with the help of my colleagues and loved ones. Generational trauma Generational or intergenerational trauma is a type of trauma that's experienced across generations of a family, culture or group. For example, there's some evidence that shows children and grandchildren of people who survived the Holocaust experience higher rates of mental health problems. Trauma that happened in the past has an impact on the mental health of current generations. But it's not always clear how. Some researchers think trauma may affect our genes. But it's more likely that trauma affects the environment we grow up in. This can be through things like: Stories or warnings older generations have passed on about the trauma they experienced. This could make you wary of the world around you. The legacy of trauma continuing to impact your wellbeing and safety, such as the ongoing effects of colonialism on the health and wellbeing of people of colour. Trauma affecting how older generations have raised and looked after us. For example, if your parent avoided certain places due to their experience of trauma, you might also feel anxious in those places. This might be more likely to happen if older generations haven't had support for their traumatic experiences when they needed them. As a second-generation South Asian woman, my lived experience has given me a deep understanding of the impact of marginalisation, poor mental health, and racial and intergenerational trauma, and how they intersect Moral injury Moral injury means how you feel when you're put in a situation that goes against your morals, values or beliefs. It's often seen in people who have been in situations where they need to make big decisions about other people's lives. Moral injury might happen because of: Lack of resources provided by a workplace, government or ruling body to treat everyone equally. Poor safety practices. Regulations or orders from people in charge that don’t seem to be in people’s best interests. Unsafe or immoral behaviour from others, particularly those in charge. Working in a system you see as failing, but have no power to fix. This kind of trauma can impact your view of the world, your government, or the organisation you work for. Along with other effects of trauma, you might: Feel a lack of purpose in your personal or professional life. Feel disconnected from people around you. Feel betrayed, alienated or ashamed. Question your moral codes and ethics. If the moral injury happened in the workplace, you might also have difficult feelings about continuing to work there. It can be difficult to seek help in the workplace in these situations. This is because the people running the workplace can be part of the cause of moral injury. If you need to talk to someone about wrongdoing in your workplace, the charity Protect provides confidential support. Racial trauma The impact racism can have on your mind and body is sometimes described as racial trauma. There's no universal definition of racial trauma. Some people use it to mean all the effects that encountering racism can have on how we think, feel and behave. Others use it to describe a specific set of symptoms. Find out more about racial trauma . Secondary trauma Secondary trauma is when you witness trauma or you're closely connected to it. But you don't experience the trauma directly. It's sometimes called vicarious trauma. For example, if you're a journalist who often reports on traumatic events. Or if you're a medical professional working in an accident and emergency department. Effects of secondary trauma are similar to general trauma. But you may find you also begin to feel detached from the trauma. Or treat it as a very separate part of your life. Experiencing secondary trauma is as valid as any other kind of trauma. It can impact you just as much."
"How could trauma affect me? This page covers: How our bodies respond to danger. How trauma makes us feel. Experiences we might have after trauma. Can trauma cause mental health problems? How else might trauma affect me? Trauma can affect everybody differently. So you might recognise some of the experiences listed on this page. But you might also have experiences or reactions that aren't mentioned here. I remember looking at pictures of myself around this time and I still feel you can see a fundamental change, the sparkle in my eyes just dims, it’s almost as if the light of joy was snubbed out. How our bodies respond to danger. When we feel stressed or threatened, our bodies release hormones called cortisol and adrenaline. This is the body's way of preparing to respond to danger, and we have no control over it. This can have a range of effects, which are sometimes called: Freeze – feeling paralysed or unable to move. Flop – doing what you're told without being able to protest. Fight – fighting, struggling or protesting. Flight – hiding or moving away. Fawn – trying to please someone who harms you. If we experience trauma, our body's reactions can continue long after the trauma is over. For example, when we're in a situation that reminds us of the trauma. This might affect how we think, feel and behave, especially if recovering from the trauma has been difficult. Four years on it's still problematic, viewing the world as a threat, constant hypervigilance, sleep problems etc which then lead onto deeper personal issues. How trauma makes us feel. Some of us who go through trauma may have these feelings, during or afterwards: Anger. Numbness or difficulty feeling any strong emotions. Like you have lost your identity or a sense of who you are. Scared or panicked. Grief. Worried. Irritable. Confused. Restless. Unsure of what you need or want. Hypervigilance - which is when you are very alert and aware of your surroundings because you feel something bad might happen. Shock or horror. Shame. But not everyone feels the same way during or after trauma. And how we feel can change over time, even months or years after the event. Remember that any feelings are valid – even if you aren't sure why you're feeling that way. I felt terrible, I couldn’t focus. I felt lost, anxious Self-blame When we go through trauma we might feel as if we're to blame. This can cause very strong feelings of shame or guilt, even if it wasn't our fault. Reasons for feeling self-blame include: Your mind trying to make sense of what's happened, and to avoid overwhelming feelings of anger, grief or betrayal. Finding a way to survive in an unsafe or stressful situation, such as living with someone who's harmed you. Wishing you could have done something differently at the time, even though you couldn't have. Someone else blaming you for what happened or acting like it was your fault. Being made to feel responsible for someone else's actions, even when they had power over you. Self-blame can be very hard to cope with. But it can be a way your mind tries to protect you. So it might take time and support to be able to start feeling differently. You might feel confused or overwhelmed if someone else says it wasn't your fault. Although hearing this can also be a relief. There's also an inherent sense that you did something wrong – either that you caused what happened to you, or that you should be dealing with it better. Physical effects of trauma Trauma can also affect our bodies physically. We might experience: Headaches. Aches and pains around the body. Shaking. Tiredness. Sweating. Changes to how often we eat or what we feel like eating. Memory problems. Dizziness or changes in vision. This can also lead to other long-term physical health problems that are linked to stress. See our information on the physical signs of stress to learn more. I found myself in excruciating pain – screaming, crying, shaking, rocking, sobbing, and then dissociating. Experiences we might have after trauma. The physical and emotional effects of trauma can lead to certain experiences such as: Flashbacks – reliving aspects of a traumatic event or feeling as if it's happening now. It could involve seeing images of what happened, or experiencing it through other senses like taste, sound, or physical sensations in your body. See our information on flashbacks. Panic attacks – a type of fear response. They're an exaggeration of your body's response to danger, stress or excitement. See our information on panic attacks. Dissociation – one way your mind copes with overwhelming stress. You might feel numb, spaced out, detached from your body or as though the world around you is unreal. See our information on dissociation and dissociative disorders. Sleep problems – you might find it hard to fall or stay asleep, feel unsafe at night, or have nightmares. See our information on sleep problems. Self-neglect – this is when you're not able to look after yourself and meet basic needs like eating, keeping clean or keeping your home safe. You might neglect yourself because of low self-esteem, or because you're having trouble adjusting to life following a trauma. Trauma might disrupt your regular routine. This can make it harder than usual to look after yourself. Some trauma might put us in situations where we have limited resources to meet these basic needs. Self-harm – when you hurt yourself as a way of dealing with very difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. See our information on self-harm. Suicidal feelings – including being preoccupied by thoughts of ending your life, thinking about methods of suicide or making plans to take your own life. To find out more, see our information on coping with suicidal feelings. You can also contact Samaritans any time on 116 123 or [email protected]. Alcohol and substance misuse – a way you might try to cope with difficult emotions or memories. See our information on the mental health effects of recreational drugs and alcohol. You can also get confidential advice about drugs and alcohol on the FRANK website. For tips on coping with the effects of trauma, see our page on coping with trauma . The accident kept replaying in my mind — the sight, sound, touch and smell of those moments were repeated many times each day, in what I finally came to understand were flashbacks. Can trauma cause mental health problems? Trauma is a possible cause of many mental health problems. It can make us more vulnerable to developing them. But for most mental health problems, there are usually other factors involved as well as trauma. See our mental health A-Z for information on any mental health problems you may be experiencing. When does trauma become PTSD? Some mental health problems can develop directly because of trauma. These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD) . Just because you've experienced trauma, it doesn't mean you will always develop these problems. The symptoms of trauma can be very intense. But these feelings will often fade over time. You may be experiencing PTSD if these symptoms don't go away after a month. Or if you find that they're significantly affecting your day-to-day life. This might mean you need extra support with your mental health. See our information on PTSD and complex PTSD to learn more, including where to get help. I had around 10 sessions with the counsellor…I told her about the thoughts I had been having that were scaring me, the anxiety and panic attacks, sleepless nights and nightmares, everything…She helped me accept that I had been suffering with PSTD and how to manage it all. How else might trauma affect me? The effects of trauma can last for a long time. Or they can come and go. You might find you have difficulty with day-to-day aspects of your life, including: Looking after yourself. Holding down a job. Trusting others. Maintaining friendships or relationships. Remembering things. Making decisions. Your sex life. Coping with change. Understanding your traumatic experience alongside your religious beliefs. Simply enjoying your leisure time. In some cases, trauma can have a serious impact on your ability to work.  Some of us might find faith a way of coping with the trauma. But some of us might find it hard to understand our traumatic experience alongside our religious beliefs. Our useful contacts page lists some organisations you could get in touch with. How you're affected may depend on other things too, such as: Previous experiences of trauma. Other stresses or worries at the time or later on. Being harmed by people close to you. Whether anyone helped or supported you. It took ages for me to start feeling safe. I'd be out in public with mates, and a car would backfire, or a stranger would shout something to a friend just a bit too loudly, and I'd be halfway into a panic attack before I'd even realised it had begun."
"Coping with trauma. Trauma can cause strong feelings and difficult experiences. It can take time and support to be able to cope. But there are things you can try that might help with how you're feeling. This page has tips to help you: Care for yourself after a traumatic experience. Cope with difficult feelings right now. Find long-term ways to cope. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. Caring for yourself after a traumatic experience. Looking after yourself straight after a trauma might not be possible. You might not realise you've been through something traumatic. Or you might not have time or space to care for yourself. Your mind might be in a survival mode, or you might not have full control of your actions. But if it feels possible, there are things you can try to care for yourself. You may also be able to get support from other people in your life, or helpful organisations . Keep yourself safe If the trauma has made you feel unsafe or threatened, it can help to go to a safe space. This could be a friend of family member's home, a refuge, a hospital, or just somewhere away from the trauma. If this isn't possible, our useful contacts page has organisations who can support you. Get medical help if you need it If your body has been harmed, get any medical help you need. When we experience trauma we can go into shock. So you might not realise you've been harmed right away. If it feels urgent, call 999 or visit A&E. For anything less urgent, you can contact NHS 111 (England) or NHS 111 Wales . Try to look after your basic needs After trauma, we might forget to eat, sleep and look after ourselves. These things might feel very difficult. But resting and hydrating ourselves gives our mind the energy it needs to process the trauma. And can help us think what we need to do next. If sleeping is difficult, giving yourself some time to sit or lie down can help. Sleep when you need to, even if this isn't when you'd normally sleep. Our relaxation tips might help. If you're finding it difficult to eat, try to snack throughout the day. Or change your meal times to when you feel more hungry. Bland foods might feel easier to eat, rather than food with lots of flavour. Our information on food and mental health has some tips that may help. Prioritise what to decide now and what can wait After trauma, you might need to make some decisions for your safety and wellbeing. But trauma can make us feel confused. This can make it harder to make decisions. Where you can, try and think of whether you need to make a decision now. Or whether it can wait a while. If there are important decisions that you don't feel you can make, some of these organisations might be able to help: Citizens Advice – free support for issues such as benefits, debt, employment and housing. Shelter – free support on housing problems. Bereavement Advice Centre – practical advice on what to do when someone dies. Refuge – support and information about your rights if you're experiencing domestic abuse. Scope – help with your rights if you have a disability. And access to things like disability benefits and adaptations to your home. PALS – help with complaints and issues with NHS care. You may also be able to get support from your local council's health and social care team. But you will have to meet certain criteria.  Feel your emotions You might feel like you need to be strong. Or that showing certain types of emotions is a sign of weakness. You also might find the way you feel is not what others expect. It's ok to cry, be angry, or laugh. Try and speak with someone you trust so you can express how you're really feeling. If people are being judgemental, you could show them our page on trauma for friends and family . It might help. Focus on your breathing and ground yourself When we experience trauma, we can become very anxious and overwhelmed. You might feel like your heart is beating fast, you're struggling to breathe, or you're shaking. In these moments, try to focus on your breath. Breathe in and out slowly. You can also try some grounding techniques . These can help to bring you back to the current moment. And can help you do what you need to right now – such as getting somewhere safe. Dissociation during trauma In some situations, we might dissociate during or straight after a trauma. Dissociation is when you feel disconnected from yourself and the world around you. It's a way our minds might react to keep us safe. In some situations, it might not always be safe to experience the current moment. Dissociating can separate our mind from this. It doesn't always mean you're unable to move or do anything. You might actually be doing a lot that you don't realise or remember. What's important is that you're safe. Coping with difficult feelings after trauma. The effects of trauma can last a long time. They might go away and come back. Or they can show up for the first time, long after the trauma has happened. We might experience overwhelming, distressing feelings related to the trauma at random times. This can happen even if we're feeling happy and well overall. These are some tips for coping with difficult feelings in the moment. Flashbacks Tell yourself that you're safe and the trauma isn't happening now. Touch or hold an object that reminds you of the present. Describe your surroundings out loud, count your footsteps while walking, or try to remember the lyrics to a song to distract yourself. Count objects of a certain type or colour.  Panic attacks Breathe slowly in and out while counting to five. There are videos online and apps you can use to help pace your breathing. Stamp on the spot. Taste mint-flavoured sweets or gum, or something sour. Touch or cuddle something soft. Wrap a blanket around you. A weighted blanket can help, if you find a sense of pressure comforting.  Dissociation or feeling spaced out Breathe slowly while counting. Hold an ice cube or splash cold water on your face. Touch something with an interesting texture or sniff something with a strong smell. Imagine a place that feels safe to you.  Having nightmares Remind yourself that you're safe. Do something calming before you try going back to sleep. This could be out of bed, if it helps you feel calmer. Have an object next to your bed that helps ground you or makes you feel calm. Try to avoid drinking, eating or smoking things that keep you awake and alert. Try a relaxation exercise. Feeling sad, depressed or lonely Write down your feelings or keep a journal. Do something creative. Talk to someone you trust. Or try peer support, to share how you feel with people who have similar experiences. Spend some time in nature. This could be going outside, or just opening a window for some fresh air.  Feeling like you want to self-harm Rub ice over where you want to hurt yourself. Massage your hands or the place you want to hurt yourself. Stick sellotape or a plaster on your skin and peel it off. Take a cold bath or shower.  Music always helps me. Lying down with my headphones on and blocking out the world is the best way [for me] to stop panic/overthinking. Helping yourself in the long-term. If you experience long-term effects of trauma, you may want to find ways to support your mental health. This might include finding ways to deal with negative feelings, or open up to others about your experiences. These tips can help: Get to know your triggers Some experiences, situations or people might trigger reactions like flashbacks, panic attacks or dissociation. These can include reminders of past trauma, such as smells, sounds, words, places, or books and films. You might find things difficult on significant dates, such as the anniversary of a traumatic experience. Or some seasons or times of year might be hard, such as Christmas. You might not always be able to avoid your triggers. But understanding them can help you be prepared and help manage them when they do happen. Recording your moods in a diary could help you spot patterns. Or it might help you to notice early signs of your feelings changing. I learned a lot of new vocabulary on my journey... things like triggers and flashbacks seemed such powerful words that I couldn't begin to imagine how they could be applied to me... but I now know how subtle these things are too. Talk to someone Some of us who've been through trauma can find it hard to open up to others. This might be because we feel unable to share what has happened or can't remember it clearly. If you struggle with this, you can still talk about how you feel right now. This doesn't mean you have to describe the trauma itself. It could help to talk to someone who you trust. This might be someone you know. Or a professional, like your doctor or a trained listener at a helpline . I am pleased to say that with support from my family and loved ones the coming days and weeks got easier, and my body began its slow road to recovery. This in turn helped with the reaction to mental trauma I had been through too Give yourself time Everyone has their own response to trauma. It's important to take things at your pace. Try to be gentle and patient with yourself. You might feel pressure from people around you to move on. But coping with trauma often takes time. It's not a straight-forward process. I refer to my bad days as a 'write off', and on those days I forgive myself for not participating in daily activities. I accept that my mind and body need to just rest and do nothing. Find ways to relax Finding ways to relax can help with our wellbeing, especially when we feel stressed, anxious or overwhelmed. Our pages on relaxation have tips you could try. It may also help to spend time in nature. Being outside in green space can help us feel more in touch with our surroundings.  I have to be patient and trust in my recovery. It won't happen overnight. I've learned that I need to find ways to relax, whether it be mindfulness, reading, gaming or becoming invested in a new television series. Make a self-care or sensory box A self-care box can contain things that make you feel calm, relaxed or comforted during difficult times. They can help with anxiety, low mood and depression. A sensory box is similar, but is filled with things that can help ground you in the moment. They can help manage experiences like panic attacks, dissociation, or flashbacks. Some things you might include in a self-care box could be: Favourite books, films or CDs. A stress ball or fidget toy. Helpful sayings or notes of encouragement. Pictures or photos you find comforting. A notebook and pen to write down your thoughts. Puzzles or colouring books to distract yourself. A soft blanket or cosy slippers. A nice smelling candle or lavender bag. Something with an interesting texture or feel. Certain smells trigger me, such as alcohol or a certain colour. So for sensory grounding I make sure that I use non-triggering things Try peer support Peer support brings together people who have had similar experiences. To find peer support, you could: Ask your doctor or healthcare team. Try an online peer support community, such as Mind’s Side by Side. Find a local support group through an organisation such as the National Survivor User Network (NSUN), Together UK or Rethink. Contact an organisation specialising in trauma, such as those listed on our useful contacts page, to see if they offer trauma-informed peer support. Contact Mind’s Infoline or a local Mind to see what support there is in your area.  If you're seeking online peer support, it's important to look after your online wellbeing. Our page on looking after your mental health online can help. I spoke to some other survivors and realised they felt the exact same way. Talking to them was brilliant. It made me realise that while my behaviour had changed, I was just coping the way I could, that we all were. Find specialist support It may help to contact an organisation that specialises in supporting trauma. Or with expertise in the type of trauma you've experienced. See page of useful contacts for trauma for organisations who can help. If you're experiencing difficult physical or mental health effects of trauma, speak to your GP. They may be able to refer you to specialist support, or suggest things that can help. I still get anxious or have the odd panic attack from things I see, smell or do. But from what I had learned from my counsellor, I could use to help calm myself down and manage the feelings a lot better. Build a routine Trauma can disrupt our usual daily routine. This might be because of how trauma makes us feel. Or because a traumatic event has changed a big part of our lives. Building a new routine can help us adjust to the changes in our lives after trauma. And help make sure that we aren't always focusing on the trauma. In your routine, you might want to consider things like physical activity, food, and spending time with others. These things can feel difficult to do after trauma, especially if they aren't part of our routine. Our pages on wellbeing have more ideas that you could build into your routine. Managing sleep problems Many of us who've experienced trauma have problems sleeping. You might find it hard to fall or stay asleep, or feel unsafe during the night. Or you may feel anxious or afraid of having nightmares. It may help to try these tips: Keep a light on. This may help if you struggle to sleep in complete darkness. Comfort yourself. For example, you could curl up in a soft blanket or cuddle a pet or soft toy. Play soothing sounds. If silence makes it harder for you to sleep, you could try listening to something as you fall asleep. For example music, nature sounds or people talking, such as podcasts. Plan a relaxing bedtime routine. This can help to manage anxiety that might make sleeping difficult. It could involve reading, using a hand cream, or doing breathing exercises. The routine can be as long or short as you need it to be.  Try something creative Expressing yourself creatively can help to process traumatic experiences. You could join a group or do something creative on your own. It doesn't have to be something you show other people if you don't want to. You could try: Dancing. Acting and theatre. Writing, such as poetry or short stories. Singing or playing music. Painting, drawing or making sculptures. Knitting, crochet, embroidery or cross stitch. You can find groups for creative activities in places like libraries, or websites like MeetUp . Some local Minds also offer creative workshops for wellbeing. Learning to sew and recently to crochet... has brought me into contact with others with the same interests in environments where I can feel safe... it helps me to focus and stay still, as well as producing something which is beautiful."
"Treatment and support for trauma. This page is about treatments that may help with the mental health effects of trauma. It covers: Talking therapies. Arts and creative therapies. Medication. Crisis services. Accessing treatment. Everyone has their own response to trauma. Not everyone will feel they need treatment. If you're looking for treatment, what you're offered will depend on your symptoms and diagnosis (if you have one), and on your needs. It also depends on what services are available in your area. What helps is different from person to person, and can change over time. It can help to keep an open mind and explore different options. The treatments for trauma are not always the same as recommended treatments for PTSD or complex PTSD.  The right medication has helped, and I’m finding it easier to cope than I was a year ago. I’m waiting for CBT and I’m learning to be compassionate with myself. Talking therapies. Talking therapies give you space to explore difficult feelings and experiences with a trained professional. You might find this helpful if you're struggling to process or understand your trauma. Or if you want to talk about your experiences confidentially. There aren't guidelines recommending certain types of therapy for trauma. What works best will be personal to you. But research shows that therapy may be more helpful if the therapist: Has a good understanding of trauma. This doesn't mean they need to have experienced trauma themselves. But that they understand how it affects people. Understands your cultural or religious background. And knows how this might affect our response to trauma. Can work with you over a long period of time. Time-limited therapies often don't give enough space to build trust. Find out more on our pages on talking therapy and counselling , including tips on how to get the most from therapy . I learned through therapy that I actually probably did survive because I used those coping behaviours, [which] were damaging, but they were the only ones I knew at the time. If you're giving evidence in a criminal trial The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has published guidelines for vulnerable witnesses and victims of crime. This includes anyone giving evidence about rape or sexual assault. They advise that the most important factor when considering the option of having therapy as a victim or witness is your health and wellbeing. In the run up to the criminal trial, the police can request access to a victim's therapy notes. The police can request this if they reasonably think that the notes might reveal material relevant to the investigation or the likely issues at trial. Arts and creative therapies. Arts and creative therapies are treatments involving activities like art, music or drama. They happen in a therapeutic environment, with a trained professional. You don't need to have done these activities before. Or have any particular skills or knowledge. These therapies can help to address difficult feelings and experiences without using words. They can also help you represent and approach your trauma in different ways. Find out more on our page on arts and creative therapies . Medication. Some of us may find medication helps to manage the symptoms we experience after trauma. The type of drug you're offered will depend on the symptoms you're experiencing. And any other health needs you might have. Before you decide to take any medication, make sure you have all the facts you need to feel confident about your decision. Our information on psychiatric medication has guidance on what you might want to ask your doctor. This includes information about your right to refuse medication . Benzodiazepines and trauma Benzodiazepines are a type of sedative medication that slow down the body and brain's functions. Benzodiazepines are not recommended if you have recently experienced trauma . Evidence suggests that they can affect your ability to recover. But they are sometimes prescribed to treat severe anxiety and insomnia. These are symptoms you might experience following a traumatic event. If you feel medication could help with severe anxiety or insomnia, you could ask your doctor about: Non-benzodiazepine anxiety mediation. Non-benzodiazepine sleep medication. Complementary and alternative therapies. Complementary and alternative therapies include many different types of therapy, such as body-based or meditation-based therapies. There are different levels of evidence on what therapies are effective. But some research suggests these therapies might help with symptoms of trauma: Acupuncture. Aromatherapy. Hypnotherapy. Massage. Mindfulness. Using a weighted blanket. Yoga. Our pages on complementary and alternative therapies have more information on these treatments, including how they work and their safety. For me my mindfulness needed to be straightforward enough that I didn’t need to stress over it but have an element of challenge for mind to focus on and take me away from the emotions that were currently too big. Crisis services. Crisis services can help if you're going through a mental health crisis. For example: Samaritans are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can call 116 123 for free, email [email protected] or visit some branches in person. You can also call the Welsh Language Line on 0300 123 3011 (7 pm–11 pm every day). Local support services may be available in your area, including day services, drop-in sessions or issue-specific support. Crisis teams can support you at home during a mental health crisis. Crisis houses offer intensive, short-term support to help you manage a mental health crisis in a residential setting, rather than in a hospital. For more information, see our pages on crisis services . Accessing treatment for trauma. These are some ways you could access treatment and support for trauma: Your GP. For advice on preparing for a GP appointment, see our page on talking to your GP about mental health. Self-referral. Some areas run services which you can contact directly to refer yourself for talking therapy. Your GP might give you information about this. If you live in England, you could try the NHS talking therapies finder on the NHS website. Our page on talking therapy and counselling includes more information about NHS talking therapies. Specialist organisations. See our useful contacts page for organisations that may offer therapy or other support for particular types of trauma. They may also be able to put you in touch with local services. Local trauma services. Some organisations offer free or low-cost trauma therapy. Your local Mind may have information about services in your area. Private therapists. Finding a private therapist is another option some people choose to explore. But it can be expensive so isn't an option for everyone. Find out more on our page on finding a therapist. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – which produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare – recommends treatments for particular mental health problems rather than for trauma overall. This could affect what treatment you're offered on the NHS. To find out about treatments for particular mental health problems, see our mental health A-Z . Trauma-informed care Trauma-informed care is now very common in the NHS. If a service says it's trauma-informed, this means all staff should: Understand how trauma can affect people, including how mental health problems can be reactions to trauma. Ask sensitively about past trauma, and offer appropriate support if you disclose it. Understand how mental health services can cause harm if they aren't trauma-aware. Understand your strengths and recognise what has helped you survive and cope. Be trustworthy, transparent and involve you in your care. What if I'm not offered the right type of treatment? The NHS should provide care and treatment that is appropriate for you, and meets your needs and preferences. If your mental health problems relate to trauma, this should include receiving trauma-informed care. Visit our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem for information on accessing the right treatment for you. If you don't feel like you're offered treatment that is right for you, you could talk to the provider and explain this to them. If you're finding it hard to access support, our page on overcoming barriers has some suggestions that could help. If speaking to your provider about what you want doesn't work, you could make a complaint . And if receiving the wrong kind of care has caused you harm, this could be clinical negligence . You would need to show that a healthcare professional failed in their duty to take care of you, and you experienced damage or loss as a result of that failure."
"Overcoming barriers to getting help for trauma. This page has information about: Barriers to opening up about trauma. Barriers to seeking help for trauma. How can I overcome these barriers? These are just some of the barriers people may experience when seeking help for trauma. You might face others that aren't listed here. We have more information on barriers to accessing mental healthcare , and on how to make yourself heard . I had an accident that left me unable to walk. I still cannot talk about the details outside of a therapy setting. Barriers to opening up about trauma. Recovering from trauma can often include talking about what happened. And developing our own way of thinking about what happened. This can be a difficult process. You may find that certain things make it harder to open up. For example: Experiencing stigma and blame There can be stigma around certain types of trauma and experiences. This can make it difficult to talk about what's happened to you. You might worry that people will blame you for the trauma. Maybe this happened to you in the past. This can make it hard to trust people. Feeling unsafe You might not be able to tell anyone about your trauma because you're scared for safety. For example, if you're experiencing abuse from a family member or someone you're living with. If you're experiencing abuse from a partner, family member, or someone in a position of power, help is available. See our useful contacts page for who to contact when you are unsafe. Struggling to talk or cope with what happened Talking about a traumatic experience can bring up very strong feelings. It may trigger reactions like panic attacks, dissociation or suicidal feelings. You may also not remember what happened or know how to understand your experiences. This can make it hard to talk about. And there might be times when you feel like you just can't cope, or it all seems too hard. This can make it feel much harder to open up about what you're going through. People misunderstanding trauma Some people might not understand trauma like you do. This might mean they don't understand your strengths or what's helped you survive. For example, you might feel that your coping mechanisms are being judged or criticised. Family or community members may be hostile or critical if you seek help. Or they may deny or dismiss what you're going through. Some people might not understand why you found a certain experience traumatic. This is especially if they experienced something similar and feel differently about it. 20 years ago I left my family home and moved 250 miles to get away from a prolonged family trauma. I didn’t want to be around my family because of their opinions and behaviour. Barriers to seeking help for trauma. Seeking help for the effects of trauma can be difficult. You might sometimes face barriers to getting the support you need. For example: Bad experiences of seeking help This may include professionals not listening to you or helping you. Or if you've been harmed by poor healthcare. If you try something and it doesn't help, it can feel harder to try again. Explaining things to many people You may talk to several healthcare professionals before you can get the right support. This could mean you're asked the same questions a number of times. You may have to recount your traumatic experiences more than you feel comfortable doing. Getting the right help for you Some professionals may emphasise treatments that don't feel right for you, such as medication. You might prefer them to address the causes of the trauma you're experiencing. Too much focus on trauma Some professionals may try to define you by your trauma. They might use it to explain everything you do or feel, even if you don't feel like it's related. You might also be given a diagnosis you don't agree with because of your trauma. Professionals don't recognise your trauma Some professionals may not recognise your experiences as traumatic. This could be because they have a different idea of what they think trauma is. This can be a very distressing experience. Some professionals might also believe harmful stereotypes about certain groups of people. These stereotypes could lead them to dismiss experiences of trauma. For example, women being dismissed as overly emotional or overreacting, rather than their experiences and symptoms being taken seriously. My time at hospital is something I’ve sought support for in therapy since leaving – it was that bad. If you're unhappy with how professionals are treating you, you can complain.  If you've been abused by health and social care professionals, our page on abuse has some organisations that can help. How can I overcome these barriers? If you're facing barriers like these, here are some things that could help: Write things down. This could help if it's too hard to say things out loud or you don't want to repeat them. Focus on safety. If you're restricted in what you can talk about, focus on making sure you're safe. Having a safety plan could help keep you safe, even if you can't leave home straight away. End the Fear has a safety plan template you can download and fill out. Choose what you share. What you tell people about your experiences is up to you. You don't need to tell your whole story, or even any of it. Your feelings are valid and you deserve support. Tell people what sort of support you would like. For example, asking someone to listen and not give you advice. Ask professionals about their expertise. You can ask if they have specific training and experience of working with trauma. And about anything else that concerns you. Show people this information. It may help them to learn more about trauma. Anyone can try therapy. Some people think you can only get help from a therapist if you feel ready to open up. But this isn't true. Therapists who understand trauma should support you and help you cope, regardless of how much you can share. Make choices where you can. For example, you might be able to request a therapist of a particular gender. Or choose to sit facing the door if that feels safer for you. See our information on getting the most from therapy for more suggestions. Focus on how you feel now. It doesn't matter whether you remember or understand what happened. You can still seek help for how the trauma has affected you, and for what you're experiencing you now. Talk to Mind. Our Infoline can help you explore options for support near you. And we have local Mind branches in England and Wales who provide a range of helpful services. If you've tried something and it hasn't helped, try to be gentle and patient with yourself . Coping with the effects of trauma can be difficult. It can take a lot of time and energy. But many people find that when they have the right combination of treatments, self-care and support, it is possible to feel better."
"Helping someone else with trauma. This page is for friends and family supporting someone who has experienced trauma. It can be hard if someone you care about is struggling with the effects of trauma. Or if they're in a long term, traumatic situation. But there are things you can do that might help. This page has some suggestions for ways you can support them while also looking after your own wellbeing: Be a good listener. Manage your expectations. Learn their triggers. Try not to judge. Offer practical support. Respect their privacy and boundaries. Help them set boundaries. Engage in fun and relaxing activities. Help them find support. Look after your own mental health. Be a good listener. When someone experiences trauma, it's important that they know the people close to them are there to listen. You don't always need to be able to give advice or have the answers to everything. Just being a good listener is a big help. These are some tips: Give them time. Let them talk at their own pace – it's important not to pressure or rush them. Focus on listening. Try to respect what they're choosing to share, rather than waiting for your chance to talk. Accept their feelings. For example, allow them to be upset or angry about what's happened. Don't blame them or criticise their reactions. You might wonder why they didn't do something differently. But they survived however they could at the time. Use the same words they use. People vary in how they prefer to describe their experiences. For example, it's their choice whether to talk about being a 'victim' or 'survivor' of trauma. Don't dismiss their experiences. For example, don't tell them not to worry about things or that they're lucky for getting through it. Usually this isn't helpful to hear. Try to remember that people can't choose what they find traumatic or how they're affected. Only give advice if you're asked to. They might prefer to simply hear that you believe them and are there for them. Allow them to express themselves how they need to. Some of us might find it easier to express ourselves through writing or creative outlets. Supporting these ways of expressing feelings is just as valid. Accepting that I can show my vulnerability without fear of reprisal or punishment has been a big step... to do this I have had to explain to those closest to me how vulnerable I am... and many times when I appear to be the exact opposite. If someone talks to you about trauma, they might seem unemotional or casual . This could be even if they're talking about stressful or upsetting events. They might even smile or laugh. This can seem strange or confusing. But it's a normal reaction. These responses can be part of a coping mechanism or physical response. For more information, see our page on the effects of trauma . Hearing about trauma can be really hard, whether or not someone shares specific details. For example, you might feel upset or angry about what they've told you. Our useful contacts are here to support you too. And you can read more about looking after your own mental health further down this page. Manage your expectations. We might have our own ideas about what is traumatic. Or how someone should react to trauma, and how long it should take to get over it. But everyone is unique in how they experience trauma. And there's no right way to manage it or right amount of time to process it. Experiencing effects at different times Trauma doesn't affect everyone right away. Some of us may not feel it's impacting us until months or years later. We might feel like talking about it sometimes, but not at other times. This is perfectly normal. Everyone works through trauma at their own speed. It's important to not have expectations about when someone should be 'better'. Or expect it to stop having an impact on their life. It was only a few months into grief that I started apologising for it. My Facebook memories often start with ‘Sorry, I know people think I should be starting to feel better by now’ … but of course I wasn’t over my grief six months in Changes to who they are Experiencing trauma can change how someone thinks and feels, and their goals in life. It's important to understand that this change is normal. And not to pressure someone into returning to how they were before the trauma. You might need to find new ways to spend time together. Or discover new, shared interests. Try not to think about this as 'losing' the person they were. We all change over time, and this could be a great way to try something new together. A divorce after 27 years of marriage, being made homeless, having no money and being isolated, had made me into another person. Someone I didn’t recognise Stigma and trauma Some people feel unable to escape or talk about traumatic situations. This could be because of the stigma or beliefs of people around them. You may hold certain beliefs about what people should do in certain situations, such as beliefs about whether people should get divorced. Everyone deserves to be free from harm and have a safe space to process their experiences. Try to think of someone's safety as the main priority and accept their needs. This is even if they don't make complete sense to you or match your beliefs. Struggling with faith or spiritual beliefs Trauma can lead some of us to struggle with our faith or spiritual beliefs. This could be the person who went through the trauma. Or you, if you're supporting that person. Someone you know may have experienced trauma within a religious or spiritual community. To leave a traumatic environment, they may have to do things that are considered against certain religious teachings or beliefs. But this doesn't make them a bad person. Or mean you can't support them. If you're struggling with this, there are people you can talk to. This could be someone from within your religious community, or outside of it. Our useful contacts page has organisations you could contact. Try not to judge. It can be hard to understand why someone can't seem to 'move on' from trauma. Especially if you've not gone through trauma yourself. Or you feel differently about shared experiences. It's understandable to wish things could improve. But it's important not to blame them or put pressure on them to get better without the time and support they need. It's also important not to judge people if they don't react to trauma as strongly as you'd expect. Everyone has different reactions to trauma. And some of us may not be that affected by it. Don't assume that someone needs professional help or certain types of support. And don't judge their reaction as them not having felt the impact of the trauma. I wish there was more awareness of trauma and the way it affects a person's thought process and behaviour. [...] Self-preservation behaviours can be greatly misinterpreted or misunderstood. Learn their triggers. It might help to ask if any situations or conversations might trigger flashbacks or difficult feelings. For example, they might feel distressed by loud noises or arguments. Understanding their triggers could help you avoid these situations. Or help you support them when they do happen. Tips on helping someone with flashbacks Flashbacks are vivid experiences in which someone relives aspects of a traumatic event. It can be hard to know how to help during a flashback. But you don't need special training. It could help if you: Try to stay calm. Gently tell them that they're having a flashback. Avoid making any sudden movements. Encourage them to breathe slowly and deeply. Encourage them to describe their surroundings. Reassure them that they're safe. Our pages on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) explain more about what flashbacks are. There are also tips for coping with flashbacks. Offer practical support. Someone may need practical support following a traumatic event. Trauma can impact our ability to think clearly and organise. Doing things like cooking or cleaning can help. But it's important to make sure that the person you're supporting still has control. And has a say in what happens around them. Try not to take over. If you're worried about someone, it's understandable to want to help them improve things. Or to feel frustrated if they disagree about what to do. But traumatic experiences usually involve being powerless or having control taken away from you. If you pressure them or tell them what to do, this might add to their feelings of powerlessness. Instead, try to encourage and support them to make their own choices. Accepting support from those closest to me has been tough [because] I always had to be the strong one. Respect their privacy and boundaries. Don't share details of what they've gone through unless you have their permission. For example, they might not want you to tell mutual friends or family members about what has happened to them. They might also not want to discuss their experience with you at all, even if you're close. Try not to take this personally. Reassure them that you're there if they need you. This doesn't mean you need to keep everything to yourself and not get support. Our useful contacts for trauma and useful contacts for supporting someone else have some suggestions of where you can get help. Help them set boundaries. Someone who has experienced certain forms of trauma might have difficulty saying 'no' to things they don't want to do. This might come from a time during the trauma when they needed to please people to say safe. Or they may feel they need to say 'yes' to everything to keep people close to them. Reassure them that it's ok to say 'no' to things. Give them time to respond and process the request, rather than demanding an answer right away. Talk to them about what things they do and don't like doing. Allow them to help plan events with their needs in mind. Engage in fun and relaxing activities. Someone recovering from trauma might have a lot of difficult things to manage. When you spend time with them, try to include activities that are enjoyable to do and separate from the trauma. They might not always want to do this. You'll need to consider their boundaries. But finding ways to engage them in fun and relaxing activities can be very helpful. My father and my mental health. When my anxiety was really bad, or I was having panic attacks, my dad would always hug me and talk it all through to help me calm down. He always had a way to reassure me that nothing like that is going to ever happen to me again Read Catrin's blog Help them find support. If they want you to, you could help them find support. For example: You could look through the list of relevant organisations in our useful contacts for trauma. Our pages on supporting someone who is self-harming can help if someone is harming themselves. We also have pages on supporting someone who feels suicidal, if they're struggling with thoughts of suicide.  If you believe someone is unsafe. Someone who's in a traumatic environment might not be able to leave it on their own. For example, they might not have the money to leave a home that is unsafe. Or they may be being forced to stay in unsafe relationships. You might not always be able to help them get somewhere safe. Or they may choose to stay in situations for reasons you don't understand. Try not to judge the decisions they are making. Reassure them that you're there to provide support. If you believe that someone is at serious risk of harm, you can call 999. Or you could report it to your local authority's safeguarding team. Look after your own mental health. It's important to remember that your mental health matters too. You can find lots of information and tips for looking after yourself in our pages on: Supporting someone else to seek help. How to cope when supporting someone else. Managing stress. Maintaining your wellbeing. Support options for you A traumatic event can have a major impact not just on those who lived through it, but also on people around them. If you experience effects of trauma while supporting someone else (sometimes called secondary trauma ), it might help to try some of the tips from our page on coping with trauma . You might also want to talk to your GP about how you're feeling, and ask if they can offer you any treatment or support."

"What are antidepressants? Antidepressants are psychiatric drugs which are licensed to treat depression . Some are also licensed to treat other conditions, such as: anxiety disorders. phobias. bulimia (an eating disorder). some physical conditions, including managing long-term pain. Who can prescribe antidepressants? The healthcare professionals who can prescribe you antidepressants include: your doctor (GP). a psychiatrist. a specialist nurse prescriber. a specialist pharmacist. Many antidepressants can be prescribed by your doctor. But some can only be prescribed if you are supervised by a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist. These information pages usually refer to 'your doctor' prescribing this medication. They are the most likely person to prescribe you these drugs. I took medication for six months. It helped lift the fog and gave me the energy I needed to tackle the root cause of my depression. There is no shame in taking medication to treat an illness. How do antidepressants work? Antidepressants can treat the symptoms of depression or other mental health problems. But they don't always deal with the causes. Doctors will often prescribe them alongside a talking therapy , to help deal with the causes of your mental health problems. You may find that some types of antidepressant work better than others for your symptoms. Or you may find that antidepressants aren’t right for you.  What’s the science behind antidepressants? Antidepressants work by boosting the activity of particular brain chemicals, or making the activity last longer. This includes noradrenaline and serotonin, which are thought to be involved in regulating your mood. Noradrenaline and serotonin are neurotransmitters. This means that they are chemicals which pass messages between nerve cells in your brain, and between nerves and other organs in the rest of your body. By causing a change to your brain chemistry, antidepressants may lift your mood. But antidepressants don't work for everyone. And there is no scientific evidence that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance which is corrected by antidepressants. What different types of antidepressant are there? There are several different types of antidepressant. They mostly affect the same brain chemicals and cause similar effects. But some people may respond to certain antidepressants better than others. And the different drugs may cause different side effects. The different types are: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). tricyclics. monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). other antidepressants.  Or see our antidepressants A–Z for detailed information on individual antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) About SSRIs: SSRIs mainly work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin into the nerve cell that released it. This means that the serotonin acts for longer on your brain and body. You may find the side effects of SSRIs easier to cope with than with other antidepressants. But these effects can still feel unpleasant, especially when you first start taking the drugs. SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant in the UK. Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) About SNRIs: SNRIs work in a similar way to SSRIs. But they also have a significant effect on your noradrenaline reuptake, as well as your serotonin reuptake. Like SSRIs, you may find that you can take SNRIs without experiencing too many unwanted side effects. But their side effects can still be unpleasant. SNRIs are sometimes preferred for treating more severe depression and anxiety. Tricyclics About tricyclics: Like SNRIs, tricyclics affect your reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin, making their effects on your brain and body last longer. But tricyclics also affect some other chemicals in your body. This can mean they’re more likely to cause unpleasant side effects than other antidepressants. They're called 'tricyclic' because of their chemical structure, which has three rings. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) About MAOIs: MAOIs work by making it harder for an enzyme called monoamine oxidase to break down noradrenaline and serotonin. This causes noradrenaline and serotonin to stay active for longer in your brain and body. MAOIs can have dangerous interactions with some kinds of medication and food. If you take MAOIs, you need to follow a careful diet. And you should always check with a doctor or pharmacist before taking any new medication alongside MAOIs. MAOIs should only be prescribed by a specialist. You are unlikely to be prescribed an MAOI unless you've tried all other types of antidepressant, and none of them have worked for you. This is because of the dangerous interactions that are possible with MAOIs. Other antidepressants There are several other antidepressants available which don't fit into any of the categories above. For more information about these antidepressants, see our page on comparing antidepressants ."
"How can antidepressants help me? On this page: If you experience depression. If you experience anxiety. How soon will they start working? If you experience depression. If you experience depression , you may: feel very down a lot of the time. no longer enjoy the things you usually enjoy. find it hard to talk to people about how you feel. find it hard to look after yourself and carry out day-to-day tasks. self-harm or experience suicidal feelings, especially if you have severe depression. Taking antidepressants may help to lift your mood. This can help you feel more able to do things that don’t feel possible while you’re depressed. This may include using other types of support for your mental health.  If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare. This includes guidelines for prescribing antidepressants for people with different levels of depression . These guidelines suggest the following: If you’re diagnosed with severe depression, your doctor is more likely to offer you an antidepressant. This is because antidepressants are more likely to be effective for severe depression. You may be offered antidepressants alongside other treatments. If you’re diagnosed with mild to moderate depression, your doctor is likely to offer other treatments before antidepressants. For example, this could be a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The NICE guidelines recommend that antidepressants are not the first or main treatment for mild to moderate depression. This is because the unpleasant side effects of the medication can outweigh the benefits. Some doctors may offer you antidepressants alongside other treatments for mild to moderate depression. Or they may offer them instead of other treatments. Your doctor should always discuss your options with you, to help you decide which treatment works best for you. Our page on what to think about before taking antidepressants has information which may help you with this decision. If you experience anxiety. If you have a form of anxiety or phobia , an antidepressant could help you feel calmer and more able to deal with other problems. It could also help you feel more able to benefit from other anxiety treatments , such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Once I started taking [an antidepressant], I started to feel better. I was then able to start to see a psychologist and work on the deeper rooted issues. How soon will they start working? Everybody’s experience of medication is different. Most antidepressants take one to two weeks to start working. But you might feel some benefits sooner than this, such as improved sleep. Speak to your doctor if you don’t feel any benefit after taking an antidepressant regularly for two to four weeks, or if you feel worse. It’s possible that a different antidepressant might suit you better. I was a total mess before I started my antidepressants. After a struggle through the first two weeks, I began to see the light at the end of what had been a very long tunnel."
"What do I need to know before taking antidepressants? Before taking antidepressants, you may want to know about some of the risks of taking them. All medication has some kind of risk and can affect people in different ways. But there are some common reasons to be cautious about taking antidepressants. These include: if you take other drugs. if you drink alcohol. if you're under 18. if you have certain medical conditions. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding (see our page on taking antidepressants while pregnant or breastfeeding for more information). You can find out about the risks of specific antidepressants from the British National Formulary (BNF) A-Z list of drugs . Our page on what you should know before taking psychiatric medication may also help with this decision. Or you can speak to your doctor or pharmacist with any questions or concerns you have about the risks of antidepressants. If you take other drugs. You should speak to your doctor about any other drugs you take before you start taking antidepressants. This includes illegal drugs and anything you’ve bought from the pharmacy or online, such as painkillers or herbal remedies. This is because different drugs can interact with each other, which can sometimes have dangerous effects on your health. If you take more than one drug at once, the interactions can also make the side effects of each drug worse. You can find out about known interactions for individual antidepressants from the BNF A-Z list of drug interactions . Or you can speak to your doctor or pharmacist about this. If you drink alcohol. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whether it's safe to drink alcohol with the antidepressant you've been prescribed. This is mainly because alcohol interacts with most antidepressants. If you have alcohol while you are taking antidepressants, this interaction can: make you feel drowsier than you would from taking the medication on its own. affect your ability to perform certain tasks, such as driving. make you more prone to falls and confusion. This mainly affects older people. If you're under 18. If you are under 18, this information may help you decide whether to take antidepressants: Antidepressants may not be fully researched or clinically tested on people under 18 years old. This means there is less information available about the possible benefits and risks. If you are under 18 and your doctor prescribes you an antidepressant, they should be very careful about the dose. This includes accounting for your physical size. Not all antidepressants are licensed for use by people aged under 18 in the UK. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) produces guidelines on treating depression in children and young people . This guidance gives recommendations about which antidepressants can be given to children, when they should be prescribed, and who can prescribe them. If you have certain medical conditions. If you have certain long-term medical problems, your doctor may not prescribe you certain antidepressants. The NHS has a page on important things to think about before taking antidepressants . This includes information on which antidepressants may not be suitable if you have different types of medical condition. You can also speak to your doctor if you are concerned about how antidepressants may affect your overall health, including any pre-existing medical conditions."
"What side effects can antidepressants cause? Every antidepressant has possible side effects. These vary between the different types of antidepressant, and between each individual drug. This page covers: Which side effects may be caused by each type of antidepressant? How might these side effects affect me? Some of the side effects listed below are quite common, but others are rare. You may not experience many of these effects. You may also experience some side effects when you first start taking antidepressants, but feel them less after a few weeks. It's up to you to decide whether or not the antidepressant has more benefits for you than any negative side effects. Your doctor should be able to help you with this decision. Our pages on coping with side effects and receiving the right medication may also help. You can also find out about the side effects for individual antidepressants from the British National Formulary (BNF) A-Z list of drugs . Or you can speak to your doctor or pharmacist with any questions or concerns you have about side effects. It took me a long time to take an SSRI, mainly as I was terrified of the side effects listed, but my doctor finally convinced me that my depression was much worse [than the side effects]. What side effects may be caused by each type of antidepressant? These are the side effects that each type of antidepressant may cause. The lists go from the most common at the top to the least common at the bottom for each type of antidepressant, with links to more information below: SSRIs and SNRIs decreased alertness. headaches. nausea (feeling sick). sexual problems. tooth decay and oral health. diabetes. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). gastrointestinal bleeding. serotonin syndrome. suicidal feelings. neuroleptic malignant syndrome. hypomania or mania.

SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). diabetes. neuroleptic malignant syndrome. hypomania or mania. MAOIs decreased alertness. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). serotonin syndrome. diabetes. suicidal feelings. neuroleptic malignant syndrome. How might these side effects affect me? This section gives information explaining how each of the side effects listed above might affect you and your body. Antimuscarinic effects Antimuscarinic effects are side effects caused by changes to the level of the chemical acetylcholine in your body. These effects are sometimes called anticholinergic effects. If your level of acetylcholine changes, this can have effects all over the body. These effects include: blurred vision. confusion and agitation. constipation, which may become life-threatening if not treated. difficulty urinating. drowsiness. dry mouth, which can cause tooth decay in the long term. erectile dysfunction. hallucinations. hot or dry skin, and decreased sweating. increased pressure in the eye. low blood pressure (taking hot baths increases this risk). nausea (feeling sick). rapid heartbeat and disturbed heart rhythm. Decreased alertness Antidepressants can make you feel less alert or able to concentrate. This can happen especially when you first start taking them. This may affect your ability to drive and to do other skilled tasks. Diabetes Long-term use of antidepressants over several years may increase your risk of diabetes. This is especially in people who are: over the age of 30. taking SSRIs or tricyclics. Gastrointestinal bleeding A rare side effect of some SSRI antidepressants is bleeding inside your gastrointestinal system, which includes your stomach and intestines. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is higher for older people, especially those aged over 80. If you are over 80, your doctor may prescribe you a different antidepressant to avoid this risk. Hypomania or mania Antidepressants may trigger hypomania or mania in some people. This may stop if you stop taking the antidepressant. But sometimes it may be a sign of bipolar disorder . In this case, you may be given a new diagnosis and different medication. Our page on making yourself heard has tips on discussing your diagnosis with your doctor, if you feel like it doesn’t match your experience of mental health. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) NMS is a rare but serious neurologic disorder, which means it affects your nervous system. It usually happens as a side effect of antipsychotic drugs . But it can sometimes happen with antidepressants. If it does occur, it usually develops rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. The symptoms of NMS are: sweating or fever, with a high temperature. tremor (shaking), rigidity (feeling stiff and unable to move your muscles) or loss of movement. difficulty speaking and swallowing. rapid heartbeat, very rapid breathing and changes in blood pressure. changes in consciousness, including confusion, lethargy or going into a coma. High temperature and rigidity are usually the first symptoms to appear. This means NMS can sometimes be confused with an infection. But NMS can be very dangerous if it’s not detected and treated. In rare cases, it can be fatal. If you’re worried that you may have symptoms of NMS, you should contact your GP urgently or call 999 for an ambulance. What's the treatment for NMS? If you experience NMS, you will probably need treatment in hospital, where doctors can stop your medication and reduce your fever. Some other methods of treatment are used, although the evidence for the use of these is not as strong. These methods may include using: medication to relax your muscles. medication to counter the chemical effects that are thought to cause NMS. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The symptoms may last for days, or even weeks, after coming off the medication that's causing them. Many people who have had NMS once go on to get it again. If you experience NMS, you should only take antidepressants afterwards if they are essential for your mental health. And you should have the lowest dosage possible that still gives the positive effects. Serotonin syndrome This is a rare but serious condition, which can be fatal. It can happen with any antidepressant, but is more likely with an SSRI. This is especially if you take an SSRI alongside certain other drugs, such as another antidepressant or lithium . These are some of the more common symptoms of serotonin syndrome. If you experience these symptoms, you should seek immediate advice from your GP or a specialist involved in your care. Or you can contact NHS 111 in England or NHS 111 or NHS Direct (0845 46 47) in Wales for urgent medical advice: headaches. nausea (feeling sick). diarrhoea. high temperature, shivering and sweating. tremors, muscle twitching and over-responsive reflexes. agitation, confusion and hallucinations. rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure. These are some rare symptoms of NMS, but if you experience them it is a medical emergency. If you have these symptoms, you or someone else should call 999 and ask for an ambulance to take you to hospital : convulsions (fits). irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). coma (loss of consciousness). The NHS has a page on the side effects of antidepressants, which includes information on serotonin syndrome and what to do if you experience symptoms. Sexual problems Sexual problems are a possible side effect of antidepressants. The symptoms vary for different people, but they may include: delayed orgasm. inability to orgasm. spontaneous orgasm. delayed ejaculation. reduced sexual desire. If you have a penis, you may also experience: failed erection. priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours). If you experience priapism, it requires urgent medical attention. Contact your GP for an urgent appointment or go to Accident & Emergency (A&E). Sometimes these side effects may continue after you've come off the drug, possibly for some time. If your side effects last for a while, you might want to report them using the Yellow Card Scheme . Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) SIADH is a side effect of some antidepressants. It mainly happens with tricyclics, SSRIs and SNRIs. It is a rare but serious side effect, which can be fatal. Vasopressin is one of the hormones that control the production of urine in your body. It is also known as the antidiuretic hormone. SIADH makes your body secrete too much vasopressin. This causes your body to hold on to water, which lowers the level of sodium in your body. This condition is called hyponatraemia. It can lead to: confusion. convulsions (fits). hallucinations. coma (loss of consciousness). memory problems, difficulty concentrating, drowsiness and falls. This mainly affects older people. Suicidal feelings There is a possibility that taking an antidepressant could make you feel suicidal. It may happen even if you didn’t experience suicidal feelings before. This side effect is mainly with SSRI antidepressants. But it is a risk with all antidepressants. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. Some people believe antidepressants might make you more likely to act on suicidal feelings. This is because antidepressants can increase your energy and motivation levels, which may be very low while you are depressed. Early in your treatment, you may experience more energy and motivation before your feelings of depression have started to lift. This might mean you have enough energy act on suicidal urges. This is only a theory. Lots of people who take antidepressants don’t experience suicidal feelings. And if you do experience these feelings, it doesn’t always mean that you will act on them. But it is still important to get help. You can speak to your doctor about how you are feeling.  Tooth decay and oral health Any drugs which cause a dry mouth can also cause tooth decay if you take them for a long time. This side effect is most common with tricyclic antidepressants. You can speak to your dentist if you are concerned about this. They can give advice on how to care for your teeth and oral health while you are taking antidepressants."
"What withdrawal effects can antidepressants cause? All antidepressants can cause withdrawal effects. These are symptoms that can happen when you reduce your dose or stop taking the drug. This page lists some of the possible withdrawal effects for different types of antidepressant. You won't necessarily get any of these symptoms, but many people do experience some of them: SSRIs and SNRIs withdrawal effects. Symptoms that may feel new to you dizziness or vertigo. electric shock sensations in head. flu-like symptoms. problems with movement, such as problems with balance or walking, or involuntary movements. sensory disturbance, such as smelling something that isn't there. stomach cramps. strange dreams. tinnitus (ringing in the ears).

MAOIs withdrawal effects. agitation. difficulty thinking. disturbed sleep. extreme sleepiness. hallucinations. irritability. psychotic experiences, such as paranoid delusions. problems with movement. strange dreams. unsteadiness. I was worried about not being able to come off them... My doctor helped me to come off them in a controlled way, and apart from one dip just after I stopped taking them, I've been pretty OK since. Can switching antidepressants help with withdrawal? If you've been taking a drug with a short half-life , you may experience problems with withdrawal symptoms. In this case, it might be possible for you to switch to a similar drug, but with a longer half-life. You may find this drug easier to come off. For example, this may be switching from an SSRI with a short half-life to another SSRI with a longer half-life. To compare the half-lives of all antidepressants, see our page on comparing antidepressants . [When] I thought I should try to manage without the antidepressant, I did not manage to come off them, which I was incredibly harsh on myself about… I was then on [an antidepressant] until I had been well for a number of years, and then, with the help of my GP, I reduced and stopped the medication. More information about withdrawal effects. You can find out about the withdrawal effects of specific antidepressants from the British National Formulary (BNF) A-Z list of drugs . Or you can speak to your doctor or pharmacist with any questions or concerns you have about the withdrawal effects of antidepressants. Our pages on coming off psychiatric medication have more information about withdrawing from your medication. This includes help with making the decision whether to come off, and how to come off your medication safely.

"Antidepressants during pregnancy and breastfeeding. This page covers: What are the risks and benefits of taking antidepressants while pregnant or breastfeeding? What can I do to feel more in control? Further support during pregnancy and breastfeeding. I developed severe postnatal depression and OCD just three days after the birth of my daughter. I was non-functioning, I couldn't even leave the house and was suicidal... [My antidepressant] really helped, and gave me the crutch I needed to function again. I really feel like it saved my life. What are the risks and benefits of taking antidepressants while pregnant or breastfeeding? There are some risks to taking antidepressants during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. These include the following: Possible birth defects. There is evidence that taking SSRIs early in pregnancy slightly increases the risk of your baby developing heart defects, spina bifida or cleft lip. Increased risk of miscarriage and premature birth. Slightly increased risk of blood loss after childbirth. If you take SSRI or SNRI antidepressants in the month before giving birth, there is a small increase in your risk of heavy bleeding in the first 24 hours after birth (known as postpartum haemorrhage). Withdrawal symptoms in your newborn baby. Taking any antidepressant in late pregnancy has the risk that your newborn baby will experience withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include: With SSRIs and SNRIs: jitteriness, poor muscle tone, not being able to cry loudly, difficulty breathing, low blood sugar (which can cause fits), and high blood pressure in the lungs. With tricyclics: fast heartbeat, irritability, muscle spasms, restlessness, sleeplessness, fever and fits. If you are breastfeeding, antidepressants can be passed to your baby through your breast milk. It is possible that the levels could become high enough for your baby to experience side effects from the medication. If you wish to breastfeed, you should avoid taking doxepin (Sinepin). Drugs are not usually clinically tested on anyone who is pregnant. There is not much evidence around how safe it is to take antidepressants during pregnancy. Newer drugs carry a higher 'unknown' risk than drugs that have been around longer. This is because scientists have had less time to gather evidence about them. There may also be benefits to taking antidepressants during this time: You might already be taking antidepressants when you become pregnant. You may feel concerned about becoming unwell or unable to cope if you stop taking antidepressants. This may mean you decide that the best thing for you and your baby is to continue taking them, so you are well enough to care for your baby. Or you may be offered antidepressants to help treat a problem you develop during pregnancy or after giving birth, such as postnatal or antenatal depression. Your doctor can help you balance the possible risks to your baby against the benefits of taking your medication. This is to help you come to your own decision about what's best for you. But it is understandable if you feel unsure about this. You might find it helpful to seek further support during this time. When I got pregnant I was terrified of not being able to look after a child in the mental state I was in. So I tried [antidepressants]. I couldn't function anywhere near as well till I had them. What can I do to feel more in control? Being pregnant can sometimes feel like you’re giving up control of your own body. This can be stressful, but there are lots of positive steps you can take: Planning your pregnancy gives you more options early on. But it is also a common experience to find out you’re pregnant without planning it. Whatever your situation, it’s important to remember that you have the same rights as everyone else. This includes the right to choose whether or not to take medication, and to have your say in decisions about your treatment. Talk to a healthcare professional as early on as you can. This could be with your doctor or midwife, or a mental health specialist. The earlier you start talking to someone about your options, the more in control you're likely to feel. For planned pregnancies, this is as soon as you decide you want to start trying to get pregnant. For unplanned pregnancies, this is as soon as you think you might be pregnant. Seek further support, to talk through your options and decide what's right for you. If you decide to stay on your medication, ask your doctor how you can reduce any risks. For example, you may be able to manage your symptoms effectively on a reduced dose. If you decide to come off your medication, make sure you do it safely.  Our page on alternatives to antidepressants has information about other treatment and support options for your mental health. Further support during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Coming to a decision you feel comfortable with about what's right for you and your baby can be difficult.

"What are the alternatives to antidepressants? If you don't want to take antidepressants, there are lots of alternative treatments you can try. In fact, if you are diagnosed with mild depression, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for treating depression recommend that doctors offer you other treatments ahead of medication. If you are taking antidepressants, you may also want to use other options for treatment and support, as well as your medication. This page has information on some of the common alternatives to antidepressants. You may find these helpful to use instead of your medication, or alongside it: Talking therapies. Mindfulness. Arts and creative therapies. Ecotherapy. Complementary and alternative therapies. Peer support. Look after your physical health. Talking therapies.

Therapy may be offered instead of antidepressants, or in addition to them.  Mindfulness. Mindfulness is a way of giving your full attention to the present moment. Some studies show that practising mindfulness can help to manage depression. Some structured mindfulness-based therapies have also been developed to treat mental health problems more formally. For example, NICE recommends mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for managing depression. Arts and creative therapies. Arts and creative therapies help you express your feelings through things like painting, clay work, music or drama therapy. They can help you deal with your symptoms, especially if you find it difficult to talk about how you’re feeling. Ecotherapy.

Or you may walk or cycle through woodland or other areas of nature. Complementary and alternative therapies. Some people find complementary and alternative therapies help to manage their symptoms. For example, this may be aromatherapy, reflexology or acupuncture. Complementary therapies may also help manage some of the side effects of medication, if you decide to continue with it. Some herbal remedies can interact with antidepressants and other types of medication. So if you are thinking about taking a herbal remedy alongside any medication, speak to your doctor or pharmacist about whether this is safe. St John's wort St John's wort is a herbal medicine that is sometimes used to treat symptoms of depression and anxiety. It is available to buy without needing a prescription. There is some uncertainty about the effects of St John’s Wort, as well as the correct dose to take and how it interacts with other medicines.

These are: generic name and key characteristics. type of antidepressant. length of half-life. available form. dietary information. Why might I want to compare antidepressants? Understanding more about the different antidepressants available may help you talk to your doctor about what's right for you, including: If you’ve experienced problems with a particular type of antidepressant and want to avoid them. For example, if you’ve had problems with tricyclics and would like change to an SSRI. If the drug's half-life is important to you.

"What are antipsychotics? Antipsychotics are a type of psychiatric medication which are available on prescription to treat psychosis. They are licensed to treat certain types of mental health problem whose symptoms include psychotic experiences . This includes: schizophrenia. schizoaffective disorder. some forms of bipolar disorder. severe depression. the psychotic symptoms of a personality disorder. Some antipsychotics are also licensed to treat other health problems, including: physical problems, such as persistent hiccups, problems with balance and nausea (feeling sick). agitation and psychotic experiences in dementia. This is only recommended if you pose a risk to yourself or others, or if you are severely distressed. Antipsychotics can be prescribed to be taken in various different ways. Most commonly you will take them by swallowing them, in tablet or liquid form. But some of them can also be prescribed as a depot injection . This is a slow-release, slow-acting form of the medication, given as an injection every few weeks. If you are given antipsychotics in hospital, doctors may use a type of antipsychotic that you can inhale, called loxapine adasuve. But this is not available for general prescription. Who can prescribe antipsychotics? The healthcare professionals who can prescribe you antipsychotics include: a psychiatrist. your doctor (GP). a specialist nurse prescriber. a specialist pharmacist. When you are first prescribed antipsychotics, this is usually done by a psychiatrist. Your GP can also sometimes give your first prescription. But they more likely to give you ongoing prescriptions, once you are already taking the medication. These information pages usually refer to 'your doctor or psychiatrist' prescribing this medication. They are the most likely people to prescribe you these drugs. How do antipsychotics work? Antipsychotic drugs don't cure psychosis but they can help to reduce and control many psychotic symptoms, including: delusions and hallucinations, such as paranoia and hearing voices. anxiety and serious agitation, for example from feeling threatened. incoherent speech and muddled thinking. confusion. violent or disruptive behaviour. mania. Antipsychotics might not get rid of these symptoms completely. They may just stop you feeling so bothered by them. This is to help you feel more stable, so you can lead your life the way you want to. Taking antipsychotics can also reduce the risk of these symptoms returning in future (relapse). You may find that some types of antipsychotic work better than others for your symptoms. Or you may find that antipsychotics aren’t right for you.  They make me feel calm, help me sleep, stop racing thoughts and help blunt hallucinations. Meds don't make life perfect – they just help me cope with the imperfections and struggles I face. What's the science behind antipsychotics? There are several possible explanations why antipsychotic drugs may help to reduce psychotic symptoms: Blocking the action of dopamine. Some scientists believe that some psychotic experiences are caused by your brain producing too much of a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which means that it passes messages around your brain. Most antipsychotic drugs are known to block some of the dopamine receptors in the brain. This reduces the flow of these messages, which can help to reduce your psychotic symptoms. Affecting other brain chemicals. Most antipsychotics are known to affect other brain chemicals too. This may include the neurotransmitters serotonin, noradrenaline, and glutamate. These chemicals are thought to be involved in regulating your mood. Parkinsonism. Some scientists believe that certain antipsychotics work by causing Parkinsonism, which is a movement disorder. This means that they may cause some of the physical symptoms of Parkinsonism as side effects. But they may also cause the psychological symptoms of Parkinsonism, such as not feeling emotions and losing interest in activities. These effects are more common with first-generation, or 'typical' antipsychotics. Antipsychotics may help to relieve psychotic symptoms by causing changes to your brain chemistry. But the causes of psychosis can be very complex, and may be affected by your life experiences and your environment as much as the chemicals in your brain. This is why you are likely to be offered talking therapy as a treatment for your psychosis, alongside medication. This is to help you with the causes of your psychosis, while the medication helps you deal with the symptoms. What different types of antipsychotic are there? Antipsychotic drugs tend to fall into one of two categories: first generation (older), or 'typical' antipsychotics. second generation (newer), or 'atypical' antipsychotics. Both types can potentially work for different people. They also have different side effects. First generation (older) antipsychotics Key facts: These are sometimes referred to as 'typicals'. They divide into various chemical groups which all act in a very similar way and can cause very similar side effects, including severe neuromuscular side effects. But they are not all the same. For example, some may cause more severe movement disorders than others, or be more likely to make you more drowsy. Second generation (newer) antipsychotics Key facts: These are sometimes referred to as 'atypicals'. In general, they cause less severe neuromuscular side effects than first generation antipsychotics. Some are also less likely to cause sexual side effects compared to first generation antipsychotics. But second generation antipsychotics may be more likely to cause serious metabolic side effects. This may include rapid weight gain and changes to blood sugar levels. The side effects that you may experience from drugs in either group will vary, depending on your dose and how you respond to the drug that you are prescribed. For a full list of all antipsychotic drugs compared by category, form and half-life, see our page on comparing antipsychotics . For more details about specific antipsychotics, you can also look up each individual drug in our A–Z of antipsychotics . I still take antipsychotic medication today and I don't have a problem with it. I feel so much better than when I was first prescribed an antipsychotic. I know that they work for me and help."
"Could antipsychotics help me? This page covers: Which antipsychotic might be right for me? How quickly will they work? What is an emergency injection? Might I need to take other medication as well? Might I need to take two antipsychotics at once? Could taking antipsychotics make me feel worse? I decided to try antipsychotics because my hallucinations and lack of sleep were putting my safety at risk. Before I was on my medication, I was exhausted. Which antipsychotic might be right for me? The best antipsychotic for you is likely to depend on a few different factors: Your diagnosis and symptoms For example: For schizophrenia – all antipsychotics may help control the 'positive' symptoms of schizophrenia. But it is more likely that a second generation antipsychotic will be able to help with the 'negative' symptoms of schizophrenia. First generation antipsychotics often have little effect on the negative symptoms. Some of their side effects may even make your negative symptoms worse. You may try different types of antipsychotic and find that they don’t control your symptoms of schizophrenia. If you’ve tried two types of antipsychotic that haven’t worked, including a second generation antipsychotic, you may be offered clozapine. For bipolar disorder or severe depression – you are more likely to be offered a second generation antipsychotic. Your past experiences of taking medication This includes discussing what has and hasn’t worked for you in the past. For example, if you've tried one kind of antipsychotic and had lots of problems with it, you could try a different type instead. Your medical situation Our page on taking antipsychotics safely has information on when you might need to be careful about taking antipsychotics. It also covers situations when you may need to completely avoid taking antipsychotics. What you want from your treatment Your medication should always be chosen based on a discussion between you and those involved in your care, including your doctor and psychiatrist. This discussion should take your preferences into account. You could ask a trusted friend, family member, carer or advocate to join you in this discussion, if you wish.   The antipsychotic softens me – I’d be sharper and more animated without it, but I’d be at a much higher risk of spiralling high. How quickly will they work? This partly depends on how you take them: By mouth. If you take them by mouth, in tablet or in syrup form, the drug's sedative effect usually takes a few hours to begin. The liquid form may act more quickly than the tablets. Depot injection. Some antipsychotics are available by deep injection into a muscle, known as a 'depot injection'. This is a slow-release version, which acts slowly and steadily over the course of two to six weeks, or longer.  Emergency injection. In an emergency, you may be given an injection into a muscle. In this case the sedative effect is rapid, and usually reaches a peak within one hour. If you are given the antipsychotic zuclopenthixol acetate (Clopixol Acuphase) as an emergency injection, it may take 36 hours to reach its peak. See our information on emergency injections to find out more. Other factors that can also affect how quickly any medication works for you include: your metabolism. your liver enzymes. how physically active you are. Whichever method you use to take antipsychotics drugs, they may work quite quickly to make you feel calmer. But it may take days or week to reduce your psychotic symptoms. What is an emergency injection? If doctors consider you to be in an ‘emergency situation’, you may be given an antipsychotic or other sedative drug to quickly tranquillise you. Emergency medication should ideally be given to you by mouth. But if that's not possible, you may need to be given drugs as a fast-acting injection into a muscle. This is known as an emergency injection. What is an emergency situation? You are in an emergency situation if: you are behaving in a way that puts yourself at immediate risk, or puts other people at immediate risk. you have not responded to measures to try and deescalate the situation, and. you have refused to take oral medication that would calm you down, or you’ve taken that medication but it has not worked. In a situation like this, doctors may decide that you need something to calm you down as quickly as possible (this is called rapid tranquillisation ). They can do this without your consent if you are being detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, often called being 'sectioned'.  Which medications might be used for emergency injection? The antipsychotic drugs which may be given by emergency injection are: olanzapine. aripiprazole. haloperidol. risperidone. You may be given lorazepam or promethazine. These are different types of drug, but both can be used as tranquillisers. Sometimes, doctors may use lorazepam at the same time as an antipsychotic, if you are very agitated. In some cases, doctors may use zuclopenthixol acetate (Clopixol-Acuphase). This is given as an injection and can sedate you for two to three days. They should only use this if medications which last for a shorter period don’t work. What happens if I refuse the injections? If you refuse these injections, you may be restrained by hospital staff while a qualified nurse gives you the injection. This can be a very unpleasant. Anyone involved in restraining you should have had special training to avoid causing you injury. Experiencing rapid tranquillisation like this can be traumatic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has guidelines on the use of rapid tranquillisation in this setting . These guidelines state that afterwards you should be given the opportunity to: discuss the experience with the health professionals responsible for your care. write down your own record of what happened, to be kept in your hospital notes. Remember: if you are not happy with how you've been treated, you can complain.  Might I need to take other medication as well? You may be offered a combination of an antipsychotic and another drug as the best way to manage your symptoms. This is likely to depend on: your diagnosis and symptoms. the kind of side effects your main antipsychotic can cause. The other kinds of medication that you may be offered as part of your treatment include: antidepressants, if you are severely depressed. mood stabilisers, if you have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers, if you are extremely agitated or finding it impossible to sleep. anti-Parkinson's drugs. These aren't psychiatric medication, but they are sometimes prescribed alongside antipsychotics to help reduce their neuromuscular side effects. Drugs to control excess saliva. This is a possible side effect of the antipsychotic clozapine. Remember: you should always check with your doctor, psychiatrist or pharmacist before taking different drugs at the same time, or close together in time. This is in case the drugs might interact badly with each other.  It's difficult to say [how antipsychotics are working for me] as I was prescribed strong antidepressants and sleeping pills at the same time. Might I need to take two antipsychotics at once? Prescribing more than one antipsychotic drug at the same time is called polypharmacy. In most cases doctors should avoid doing this, except in specific short-term situations. For example, this may happen while you are switching from one antipsychotic drug to another. But in some circumstances you may be prescribed more than one antipsychotic on a longer-term basis. This may happen if: your regular medication doesn’t seem to be working well enough. you and your doctor or psychiatrist have found that a careful combination of two drugs is what controls your symptoms best. If you are detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983 (sectioned), doctors may be able to prescribe you more than one antipsychotic at once. In some circumstances, they may be able to do this without your consent.  Could taking antipsychotics make me feel worse? It's important to remember that all drugs can affect different people in different ways . Not everyone finds antipsychotics helpful. Many people can experience negative side effects from them. Lots of these people may find that the good effects of antipsychotics make up for the bad effects. But not everybody does. Your experience of taking antipsychotics will be personal to you. You may need to try a few different drugs before you find the one that suits you best. You can also work with your doctor or psychiatrist to find the right dosage for you . It's also important to be aware that it can be hard to come off antipsychotics. They may cause withdrawal effects if you come off them too quickly. So if you decide to try coming off your antipsychotics, it is important to come off them gradually.  To learn about the possible side effects and withdrawal effects associated with a particular antipsychotic, you can look it up in our antipsychotics A-Z .

"How to take antipsychotics safely. This page has information about taking antipsychotics safely, including what to think about before you start taking them. It covers: What tests do I need before taking an antipsychotic? What if I have a medical condition? What if I'm an older person? Could antipsychotics interact with other drugs? These pages may also help: Our pages on dosage of antipsychotics and side effects of antipsychotics have more information about taking antipsychotics safely. Our page on antipsychotics in pregnancy has information about taking antipsychotics safely if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. You can also discuss any concerns you have about taking antipsychotics with your doctor or psychiatrist. Before you take any medication. Before you decide to take any medication, you should make sure you have all the facts you need to feel confident about your decision.  receiving the right medication for you. your right to refuse medication. What tests do I need before taking an antipsychotic? Before you start taking an antipsychotic, your doctor should do the following tests to assess your physical health: Physical examination This will include taking some physical measurements and asking some questions about your health and lifestyle, to find out: your weight. your waist size. your blood pressure and pulse rate. your diet and level of physical activity. whether you show any signs of movement disorders. whether or not you smoke cigarettes. any other prescribed medicines you take, and any other drugs or substances you may take. Blood tests These are to measure your: blood sugar. haemoglobin (red blood cells). cholesterol (blood fats). prolactin level. See our information on sexual and hormonal side effects of antipsychotics to find out more about prolactin. ECG An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test used to check your heart’s rhythm and electrical activity. You should only need to have an ECG before being prescribed antipsychotics if: you have high blood pressure or any other symptom that may relate to your heart. you have a family history of heart problems. you're going to be admitted to stay in hospital. an ECG is recommended for the specific drug that you may be prescribed. Will I need more tests after I start taking antipsychotics? After you start taking the medication, your mental health team will need to continue to monitor your physical health. They will also need to monitor and record: whether you're taking your medication in the way you're supposed to. whether your medication is helping you. what side effects it's causing. This includes any side effects similar to the symptoms of psychosis, such as agitation. If you're on a high dose of antipsychotics, you should be given an ECG every one to three months. This is because antipsychotics can sometimes cause heart problems as a side effect. The risk of this happening is greater with higher doses. If you have unexplained blackouts, you should let your mental health team know so they can regularly monitor your heart rhythm. You should do this even if you’re on a low dose. If you've been taking the drug for a year and are getting on well with it, your doctor can monitor your physical health instead of your mental health team. Your doctor should review your treatment at least once a year to check that it's still working well for you. But you can ask them for a review whenever you want one. What if I have a medical condition? If you have any of the following conditions, your doctor should take care when prescribing you an antipsychotic: liver or kidney disease. cardiovascular (heart and circulatory) disease, or a family history of it. diabetes, or a family history of it. Parkinson’s disease. epilepsy. depression. myasthenia gravis (a rare disease affecting nerves and muscles). an enlarged prostate. glaucoma (a serious eye disease). lung disease with breathing problems. certain blood disorders. If you have any medical condition at all, make sure that you tell your doctor or psychiatrist before they prescribe your medication. This includes any health conditions which aren't included in the list above. Your doctor may need to monitor you even more regularly to the effects of the antipsychotic on your health. In some cases, it may not be safe to prescribe you an antipsychotic. For example, you should never be given an antipsychotic if : you have phaeochromocytoma (a type of tumour causing very high blood pressure). you are semi-conscious, unconscious or in a coma. What if I'm an older person? If you're an older person, your doctor or psychiatrist should take care when prescribing you an antipsychotic. If they do prescribe an antipsychotic, they may need to change the dosage of your medication. This is because: antipsychotics are more likely to cause your blood pressure to drop when you stand up, which may cause you to fall. antipsychotics are more likely to cause both high and low body temperature. as you get older your body becomes less efficient at dealing with drugs. This means higher doses will have more risks of problems, so you are likely to need a smaller dose. Could antipsychotics interact with other drugs? If you take antipsychotics with other drugs, they can sometimes interact with each other. This can cause unpleasant or dangerous effects. You should always speak to your doctor, psychiatrist or pharmacist before taking any drugs at the same time or close together. The information below shows the main interaction risks between antipsychotics and: all drugs with antimuscarinic properties. certain sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers. carbamazepine. lithium. tricyclic antidepressants. trazodone. over-the-counter drugs. alcohol and recreational drugs. All drugs with antimuscarinic properties All antipsychotics can cause antimuscarinic side effects . Combining them with other drugs that also have antimuscarinic effects is likely to make these side effects worse. This is especially likely if you take antipsychotics with tricyclic antidepressants . Anti-Parkinson’s drugs can also be antimuscarinic. It's possible that an anti-Parkinson's drug could interact with your antipsychotic to make you delirious. This may be confused with your psychotic symptoms . Certain sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers Some sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers can increase the sedative action of all antipsychotics. This means they will make you feel even more drowsy. This is especially likely if you take an antipsychotic with: the minor tranquillisers used for anxiety, which are buspirone, pregabalin and meprobamate. benzodiazepines. the 'Z' drugs, which are zolpidem, zopiclone and zaleplon. Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant drug, which is also used as a mood stabiliser . Taking it with antipsychotics can increase the risk that you will experience unpleasant side effects. It can also make your body process certain antipsychotics faster. This makes them less effective. The antipsychotics affected by this are: aripiprazole. cariprazine. clozapine. haloperidol. lurasidone. olanzapine. paliperidone. quetiapine. risperidone. Lithium Lithium is a type of mood stabiliser. Taking it with antipsychotics can increase the risk of: serious blood disorders, especially with clozapine. neuromuscular side effects, if you are taking flupentixol, sulpiride, haloperidol or risperidone. neurotoxicity, which is a poisonous effect on the nervous system. If your doctor or psychiatrist decides to prescribe an antipsychotic alongside lithium, they should start it at a lower dose than usual. Tricyclic antidepressants Taking tricyclic antidepressants with antipsychotics can increase the risk of disturbing your heart rhythm. This is especially likely with these antipsychotics: fluphenazine. haloperidol. risperidone. sulpiride. Trazodone Trazodone is a type of antidepressant . Taking it with certain antipsychotics can increase the risk of: experiencing severe side effects. disturbing your heart rhythm. experiencing a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up. Over-the-counter drugs Speak to your doctor, psychiatrist or a pharmacist before taking over-to-counter medicine with your antipsychotic. This includes complementary or alternative medicines . They will be able to tell you about any potential risks with taking the drugs together. Alcohol and recreational drugs Drinking alcohol can increase the sedative effect of antipsychotics. This means it will make you feel even more drowsy. You can ask your doctor, psychiatrist or pharmacist whether it’s safe to drink with the medication you've been prescribed. They can help you understand where to limit your alcohol intake. If you take certain recreational drugs with antipsychotics, they may interact with each other. For example, taking amphetamines and chlorpromazine together can reduce their effects.  You can also visit the FRANK website for confidential advice on recreational drugs."
"What dosage of antipsychotics should I be on? Your dosage means how much of your antipsychotic medication you should take (your dose), and how often you should take it. Finding the best dosage for you will depend on a lot of factors. These include: The specific drug you've been prescribed. Safe dosages for different antipsychotics can vary widely. Whether you're taking other medication. Some drugs can interact with antipsychotics if you take them at or around the same time. What you find works for you. Medication work differently for everyone. Its effects may depend on factors like your age, weight, genes, general health, liver and kidney function, and whether you're able to take the drug as recommended. You and your doctor or psychiatrist can work together to see whether your antipsychotic helps you and how well it suits you. They should be able to tell you how the drug may help you, and when you are likely to feel the drug’s effects. The aim should be to find a dosage where the benefits outweigh any negative side effects. Remember : you have a right to know what dosage you have been prescribed, and why. How can I work out my best dosage? You should always start at a low dose. For many people, low maintenance doses are as effective as higher doses. The dose should still be enough for the medication to have an effect. You should try taking the dosage you've been prescribed for four to six weeks to see how it's working. Your doctor or psychiatrist may then adjust your dose gradually. But they should only do this if you both agree it is necessary. You may find that your medication isn't working, even if your dose is increased to the recommended limit. Or you may find that your medication is causing unpleasant side effects that are difficult to live with. In this case, your doctor or psychiatrist should consider offering you a different antipsychotic drug. Your doctor or psychiatrist should clearly record any decisions about your medication in your medical notes. This includes whether to start, continue, stop or change to another drug. It is especially important if your doctor or psychiatrist prescribes a dose that's outside the usual recommended range for that drug. What are the effects of taking a higher dose? The higher your dose, the more likely you are to experience problems with side effects . For example, certain antipsychotics may cause side effects which affect your ability to: get up in the morning. move your muscles naturally. take part in everyday activities. Moderate to high doses of antipsychotics may also increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia . This is a serious side effect which causes movements in your face or body that you can’t control. PRN prescribing PRN prescribing means giving you extra doses of your medication, in addition to your regular daily dose. 'PRN' stands for 'pro re nata', which means ‘as the circumstances require’ in Latin. So it only happens in certain circumstances. You are most likely to be given a PRN dose if you are staying in hospital, either because: the medical staff think you need a bit more medication in some situations, or. you've asked for a bit more medication in some situations. Any PRN doses should be carefully recorded in your medical notes. Your doctor or psychiatrist should also monitor you to make sure that you don’t receive a daily dose that's too high. Is my daily dose too high? The British National Formulary (BNF) recommends maximum doses for many medications licensed in the UK, including antipsychotics. You can search the BNF’s A to Z list of drugs to find information about any medication you’ve been prescribed, including details of recommended doses. In most cases, antipsychotics aren’t licensed for use above the maximum recommended dose published by the BNF. But there are some situations where you may end up with a total daily dose above the recommended maximum. These include: If your doctor or psychiatrist prescribes you a higher dose than recommended daily dose. They can choose to do this at their discretion, but it should not be common. If you are taking more than one antipsychotic at the same time. If you are in hospital receiving a PRN prescription. This is the most likely situation in which your daily dose may end up higher than the recommended limit. You have a right to know how much medication you’re taking in total, including PRN doses . If you aren’t confident about working this out, your doctor, psychiatrist or pharmacist should be able to explain it to you. Your pharmacist may also have a specific chart published by the Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health UK (POMH-UK) to work out antipsychotic dosages. They can use this as a guide to help you work out your overall dosage more easily. If you are prescribed more than the recommended daily limit, your doctor or psychiatrist has a duty to review this every day. But you can always speak to your doctor or psychiatrist if you feel your daily dose is too high. You can ask them to review your dosage at any time, even if it is within the recommended range. "
"Antipsychotics during pregnancy and breastfeeding. This page covers: What are the risks and benefits of taking antipsychotics while pregnant or breastfeeding? What can I do to feel more in control? Further support during pregnancy and breastfeeding. What are the risks and benefits of taking antipsychotics while pregnant or breastfeeding? There is not much evidence about exactly how safe it is to take antipsychotics during pregnancy or breastfeeding. But there are some known risks to taking antipsychotics during this time: Risks to your developing baby in the first three months of your pregnancy (first trimester). All drugs carry higher risks during this period, when your developing baby is most vulnerable. Possible effects on your baby in the final three months of your pregnancy (third trimester). For example, there's a risk that your baby may experience a temporary muscle disorder if you take antipsychotics in the third trimester. All risks become higher in the last few weeks of pregnancy, when your baby becomes more vulnerable again. Gestational diabetes and excessive weight gain. Some research suggests that taking antipsychotics can make you more likely to put on weight and to develop diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that starts during pregnancy. Your healthcare team should monitor for any signs of gestational diabetes while you are pregnant. If you are breastfeeding, antipsychotics can be passed to your baby through your breast milk. Your baby could experience some side effects from the medication because of this. Speak to your doctor or psychiatrist if you want to breastfeed and stay on your medication. They can let you know how serious the risks are with the antipsychotic you are taking. If the risk is low, you might feel that the advantages of breastfeeding whilst taking your medication outweigh any risks. But with certain antipsychotics, they are likely to advise that you do not breastfeed. This includes if you are taking clozapine. Drugs are not usually clinically tested on anyone who is pregnant. There is not much evidence about how safe it is to take antipsychotics during pregnancy. Newer drugs carry a higher 'unknown' risk than drugs that have been around longer. This is because scientists have had less time to gather evidence about them. There can also be benefits to taking antipsychotics during this time: You might already be taking antipsychotics when you become pregnant. You may feel concerned about becoming unwell or unable to cope if you stop taking antipsychotics. This may mean you decide that the best thing for you and your baby is to continue taking them, so you are well enough to care for your baby. Or you may be offered antipsychotics to help treat a problem you develop during or shortly after pregnancy, such as postpartum psychosis. Your doctor or psychiatrist can help you balance the possible risks to your baby against any potential harm in not taking your medication. This is to help you come to your own decision about what's best for you. But it is understandable to feel unsure about this, and you might find it helpful to seek further support during this time. What can I do to feel more in control? Being pregnant can sometimes feel like you’re giving up control of your own body. This can be stressful, but there are lots of positive steps you can take: Planning your pregnancy gives you more options early on. But it is also a common experience to find out you’re pregnant without planning it. Whatever your situation is, it’s important to remember that you have the same rights as everyone else. This includes your right to choose whether or not to take medication, and to have your say in decisions about your treatment. Talk to a healthcare professional as early on as you can. This could be with your doctor or midwife, or a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist. The earlier you start talking to someone about your options, the more in control you're likely to feel. For planned pregnancies, you should do this as soon as you decide you want to start trying to get pregnant. For unplanned pregnancies, you should speak to them as soon as you think you might be pregnant. Seek extra support, to talk through your options and decide what's right for you. If you decide to stay on your medication, ask your doctor or psychiatrist how you can reduce any risks. For example, you may be able to manage your symptoms effectively on a reduced dose. If you decide to come off your medication, make sure you do it safely.  And see our page on alternatives to antipsychotics for information about other treatment and support options for your mental health. Further support during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Coming to a decision you feel comfortable with about what's right for you and your baby can be difficult. It's understandable if you feel conflicted or unsure about what to do. As well as talking to your doctor or psychiatrist, you might find these support options helpful: Talk to someone you trust. If you feel able to, it can help to talk through your feelings with someone like a partner or close friend. Midwife appointments. You can talk to your midwife about how you're feeling throughout your pregnancy. They can also help make sure you receive plenty of support from your health visitor after you give birth. Our page on talking to your GP has tips on having conversations about your mental health with any medical professional, including your midwife. Perinatal mental health services. These services offer support to help you stay well during your pregnancy. You can be referred to these services by other professionals involved in your care, such as your doctor. Online peer support. It can be helpful to talk to other people who've had similar experiences to yours. Netmums has a supportive online network for all parents and parents-to-be. You can also talk about your experiences with others on Mind’s supportive online community Side by Side.  Specialist organisations. Organisations such as Action on Postpartum Psychosis, NCT and the Breastfeeding Network provide information and support on pregnancy, breastfeeding and mental health. You might also find it helpful to read our pages on parenting with a mental health problem. These pages include information on taking care of yourself, looking after your children, and other kinds of support available to parents. Our information on perinatal mental health problems may also help."
"What side effects can antipsychotics cause? Every antipsychotic has its own possible side effects. Not everyone who takes antipsychotics will experience side effects, but many people do. This page lists the most serious side effects that are possible with any antipsychotic drug. Some of these side effects are rare. antimuscarinic effects. bed-wetting. blood disorders. body temperature problems. emotional effects. eye problems. heart problems. liver disorders. metabolic syndrome. neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). neuromuscular side effects. sedation (sleepiness). seizures (fits). sexual and hormonal problems. skin problems. suicidal feelings and behaviour. tardive dyskinesia (TD). tardive psychosis. weight gain. Certain types of antipsychotic may also have other side effects which aren’t listed here. The British National Formulary (BNF) has an A-Z list of drugs licensed for use in the UK . This list has links to find out more information about each drug, including information about side effects.  Antimuscarinic effects. Antimuscarinic effects are side effects caused by changes to the level of the chemical acetylcholine in your body. These effects are sometimes called anticholinergic effects. If your level of acetylcholine changes, this can have effects all over your body. These effects include: blurred vision. confusion and agitation. constipation, which may become life-threatening if not treated. difficulty urinating. drowsiness. dry mouth, which can cause tooth decay in the long term. erectile dysfunction. hallucinations. hot or dry skin, and decreased sweating. increased pressure in the eye. low blood pressure (taking hot baths increases this risk). nausea (feeling sick). rapid heartbeat and disturbed heart rhythm. Antimuscarinic effects are more common with some antipsychotics than others. In particular, clozapine may be more likely to cause severe constipation than other types of antipsychotic. These effects can also happen with other types of medication, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anti-Parkinson's drugs . With haloperidol my tongue hung out of my mouth and my lips were stretched wide and open. Quietiapine made me feel stoned initially, with huge weight gain. Bed-wetting. Bed-wetting can be a side effect of antipsychotics. It is more common with some antipsychotics than others. Blood disorders. Certain blood disorders can be a side effect of antipsychotics. These include: agranulocytosis. blood clotting disorders. reduced white blood cells. Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis is a blood disorder which involves the loss of one type of white blood cell. It means that you are more likely to catch infections and less able to fight them. It is very serious and people have been known to die from it. If you have the following symptoms, it may be a sign that your immune system is not working as well as it should: sore throats. mouth ulcers. a fever or chills. If you experience these symptoms, you should contact your doctor straight away. The risk of agranulocytosis is higher with clozapine than with other antipsychotics. If you take clozapine, you will have your blood tested regularly to check for this. Blood clotting disorders (venous thromboembolism or VTE) These include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thrombosis (blood clot in the lung), which can be life-threatening. Reduced white blood cells Taking antipsychotics may cause a reduction in your white blood cells. Body temperature problems. Antipsychotics can cause problems with regulating your body temperature. It may become too high or too low, both of which can make you feel unwell. Emotional effects. Antipsychotics can sometimes make you feel: anxious. excitable. agitated. aggressive. depressed (although some antipsychotics may have an antidepressant effect, making you feel less depressed). restless and unable to keep still. out of touch with reality. socially withdrawn and detached from those around you. Eye problems. Certain antipsychotics may cause various eye problems. These include: blurred vision and difficulty reading. a build-up of granular deposits in the cornea and lens. This doesn’t usually affect your vision. degeneration of the retina, which is the light-sensitive part of the eye. This can affect your vision. glaucoma, which is a serious eye condition. oculogyric crisis, which affects the muscles that control your eye movements. It can cause your eyes to turn suddenly, so you can’t control where you look. All antipsychotics also have the potential to cause narrow-angle glaucoma. This is a medical emergency. If you've ever had glaucoma or eye problems, you should be very cautious about taking antipsychotic drugs. You may want to avoid certain antipsychotics completely, especially those with antimuscarinic effects . If you’re concerned about this, you can speak to your doctor or psychiatrist to find out more. Heart problems. Antipsychotics may cause certain heart problems, such as: increased heart rate. heart palpitations, which are heartbeats that suddenly become more noticeable in your chest. effects on your heart rhythm. This has been known to cause sudden death in extreme cases. The risk of this is especially linked to being on a high dose, or taking more than one antipsychotic at the same time.  This includes information on how you can manage these risks. Liver disorders. Certain antipsychotics may cause liver disorders and jaundice (yellow skin). Metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the medical name for a combination of the following symptoms: weight gain and obesity. high blood sugar. diabetes. high blood pressure. high cholesterol. You don’t have to experience all of these symptoms to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Taking antipsychotics can increase your risk of developing metabolic syndrome. If you experiencing metabolic syndrome, this means you are at higher risk of developing: diabetes. stroke. heart disease. This risk of this is increased even more if you have an unhealthy lifestyle. Your doctors may suggest trying to eat a healthier diet and get enough physical activity can help to reduce this risk.  If you have a difficult relationship with food and eating, our pages on eating problems may help. You will also need to have regular health checks before and during your treatment.  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a rare but serious neurological disorder, which means it affects your nervous system. It can happen as a side effect of taking antipsychotics. It may also occur as a withdrawal symptom if you stop taking antipsychotics. If it does occur, it usually develops rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. The symptoms are: sweating or fever, with a high temperature. tremor (shaking), rigidity (feeling stiff and unable to move your muscles) or loss of movement. difficulty speaking and swallowing. rapid heartbeat, very rapid breathing and changes in blood pressure. changes in consciousness, including confusion and lethargy, stupor or coma. High temperature and rigidity are usually the first symptoms to appear. This means NMS can sometimes be confused with an infection. But NMS can be very dangerous if it’s not detected and treated. In rare cases, it can be fatal. If you’re worried that you may have symptoms of NMS, you should contact your GP urgently or call 999 for an ambulance. What's the treatment for NMS? If you experience NMS, the treatment is most likely to involve admitting you to hospital, stopping your antipsychotic medication and reducing your fever. Some other methods of treatment are used, although the evidence for the use of these is not as strong. These methods may include using: medication to relax your muscles. medication to counter the chemical effects that are thought to cause NMS. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The symptoms may last for days, or even weeks, after coming off the antipsychotic that's causing them. Many people who have had NMS once go on to get it again. If you experience NMS, you should only take antipsychotics afterwards if they are essential for your mental health. And you should have the lowest dosage possible that still gives the positive effects. Neuromuscular side effects. Antipsychotics interfere with the brain chemical dopamine, which is important in controlling movement. Antipsychotics may therefore cause movement disorders. These are most common with first generation (older) antipsychotics and less likely with the newer antipsychotics. They include the following: Parkinsonism Some neuromuscular side effects are similar to the effects of Parkinson’s disease, which is caused by the loss of dopamine. These effects are known as Parkinsonism, and they include the following: Your muscles become stiff and weak. You find it more difficult to make facial expressions. Certain small movements feel difficult, such as writing or picking up objects with your hands. You develop a slow tremor (shaking), especially in your hands. Your fingers move as if you are rolling a small object between them. When walking, you lean forward, take small steps and find it difficult to start and stop. Your mouth hangs open, and you dribble. Loss of movement You may find it difficult to move and your muscles may feel very weak. Having little energy to move is also a symptom of depression, so if you experience this your doctor or psychiatrist may ask if you’re feeling depressed. Akathisia (restlessness) Akathisia is a feeling of restlessness that can affect your body and your emotions. For example, you might: feel intensely restless and unable to sit still. rock from foot to foot, shuffle your legs, cross or swing your legs repeatedly, or continuously pace up and down. feel emotionally tense and uneasy. Doctors might confuse these symptoms and think you are anxious or agitated. If they don't know that you have akathisia, they may suggest taking a higher dose of your antipsychotics, to help you feel calmer. But if you have akathisia, increasing your dose of antipsychotics won’t help. So if you are diagnosed with akathisia, your doctor or psychiatrist may suggest taking another medication to reduce its effects, as well as your antipsychotic. Muscle spasms Muscle spasms are when a muscle in your body contracts against your control, and you cannot relax the muscle. They can be painful and may have serious effects. For example: If a spasm affects the muscles of your larynx (voice box), you may have problems with your voice. This is called dysphonia. You might find it difficult to speak normally, and people may find it hard to understand you. If a spasm affects the muscles that control your eye movements, it can makes your eyes turn suddenly. It may mean you can’t control where you look. This is called an oculogyric crisis. This can feel very unpleasant. It could also be dangerous, for example if it happens while you are crossing the road or pouring boiling water from a kettle. I experienced twitching, stumbling and slurred speech. Sedation (sleepiness). Sedation, or sleepiness, is a common side effect of many antipsychotics. It is more common with certain antipsychotics than others, such as chlorpromazine and olanzapine. Sedation can happen during the day as well as at night. So if you experience this you might find it very hard to get up in the morning. Or it might feel difficult to motivate yourself to be active during the day. Antipsychotics knock me out and make it very hard to function normally. Seizures (fits). Many antipsychotics have the potential to cause fits. If you've ever had fits in the past, you should be particularly cautious about taking antipsychotic drugs. Sexual and hormonal problems. Sexual problems are a possible side effect of certain antipsychotics. The symptoms vary for different people, and may include: acne (a condition causing spots and oily skin). increased hair growth across the face and body. osteoporosis (a disease where your bones become weaker and more likely to break). reduced sexual desire, difficulty getting aroused and inability to orgasm. breast development and the production of breast milk. This can affect anyone, including if you were assigned male at birth. If you have a penis, you may experience spontaneous ejaculation or priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours). If you experience priapism, it requires urgent medical attention. Contact your GP for an urgent appointment or go to Accident & Emergency (A&E) . If you have a vagina, you may experience vaginal dryness. And if you would normally have periods, they might stop or become irregular. But these changes can be unpredictable. Your periods may return, so you could still get pregnant if you have unprotected sex. Some second generation antipsychotics may be less likely to cause these sexual side effects. You can speak to your doctor, psychiatrist or pharmacist if you are concerned about these effects. Amisulpride has made my breasts grow and lactate. After having blood tests, it turns out that my prolactin levels have sky-rocketed, which is why I experienced those side effects. I am also now at risk of osteoporosis in the future. Skin problems. Antipsychotics can cause various skin problems, for example: Allergic rashes. These usually occur within the first two months of starting treatment. They usually disappear when you stop taking the drug. If you get a rash, you should contact your GP straight away to have it checked. Increased sensitivity to sunlight, especially at high doses. If you're taking antipsychotics, you may need to take extra care to protect yourself from the sun. A blue-grey discolouration in some skin types. Suicidal feelings or behaviour. Some people experience suicidal thoughts and behaviours while taking antipsychotics. This can happen particularly in the early stages of taking this medication. If you are concerned about experiencing suicidal feelings while taking antipsychotics, speak to your doctor or psychiatrist. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. Tardive dyskinesia (TD). Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a side effect of certain medications, mainly antipsychotics. It involves experiencing sudden, jerky or slow twisting movements in your face or body.  This includes information on what TD is, what treatments and support are available, and ways to help yourself cope. Tardive psychosis. Tardive psychosis is a term used to describe new psychotic symptoms that begin after you have been taking antipsychotics for a while. Some scientists believe that these symptoms may be caused by your medication, not your original illness returning. The word 'tardive' means that it's a delayed effect of the medication. This risk of tardive psychosis is one reason why it’s a good idea to withdraw slowly from your medication, if you decide to stop taking it. This is especially important if you have been taking it for a long time, as withdrawing slowly gives your brain time to readjust. Weight gain. Weight gain is a very common side effect of many antipsychotics, particularly some of the second generation (newer) drugs. This may be because antipsychotics increase your appetite, so you want to eat more than usual. They may also cause you to become less active, for example if they make you feel very tired. If you put on a lot of weight, this can increase your risk of developing diabetes and other physical health problems. It's also understandable if you feel upset or frustrated about these changes to your body. If you experience weight gain, your doctor or psychiatrist may suggest switching to another antipsychotic medication. They may also suggest that you try to eat a healthy diet and increase your level of physical activity.  If you have a difficult relationship with food and eating, our pages on eating problems may help."
"What is a depot injection? A depot injection is a slow-release form of medication. The injection uses a liquid that releases the medication slowly, so it lasts a lot longer. Depot injections can be used for various types of drug, including some antipsychotics. The medication used in depot injections is the same as other forms of the drug, such as tablets or liquid. Why might I choose a depot injection? A depot injection might be a good option for you if: you find it difficult to swallow medication. you find it difficult remembering to take medication regularly. you prefer not to have to think about taking medication every day. You may also be given a depot injection if the healthcare professionals involved in your care agree that you need the drug, but think you may struggle to take it regularly in a different form. But you will usually only be offered a depot injection if: you've already been on your medication for a while. you know it's working well for you, and. you expect to keep taking it for a long time. Not all antipsychotics are available as depot injections. See our antipsychotics A-Z or our page on comparing antipsychotics for information about the different forms available for each drug. How are depot injections given? Injections are usually given every two, three or four weeks, depending on the drug. Certain antipsychotics may last for longer periods when given as a depot injection. Your injection will usually be given by a healthcare professional in a community setting. For example, this may be in a clinic, medical centre or in your own home. You will not be given a depot injection to use at home on yourself. The injection is made into a large muscle. This is likely to be either your buttock or the largest muscle of your shoulder. Some types of antipsychotic may need to be given into a certain muscle. Whoever administers your injection should follow the guidance for your specific medication, which should be in the patient information leaflet (PIL) for your medication. You may be able to alternate between different muscles and sides of your body. This is to help prevent any injection site problems. Injection site problems If you regularly have your injection in the same place in your body, you may start to experience problems with that part of your body. This may include: abscess (a painful collection of pus). bleeding. bruising. irritation. lumps. numbness. pain. redness. soreness. swelling. If you have problems with your injection site, make sure you mention this to your doctor, nurse or whoever gives your injection. Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) If you have depot injections, you may not pick up your own prescription for your medication. This may mean you are not given the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) which usually comes in the drug packet. It's always a good idea to read the PIL carefully before taking any medication. So if you aren't given it you can ask for a copy from the person who gives the injection, or your doctor or pharmacist. Or you can see our antipsychotics A-Z for links to PILs for the different forms of antipsychotics, including depot injections."
"How can I compare different antipsychotics? This page has tables to help you compare antipsychotics by different factors. These are: generic name and key characteristics. type of antipsychotic (first or second generation). half-life. form available. dietary considerations. Why might I want to compare antipsychotics? Understanding more about the different antipsychotics available may help you talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about what's right for you, including: If you’ve experienced problems with a particular type of antipsychotic and want to avoid them. For example, if you’ve experienced problems with a first generation (older) antipsychotic and want to change to a newer drug. If you need your medication in a different form. For example, you may have problems with swallowing or find it hard to remember to take your medication correctly every day. If you have any dietary restrictions, such as being vegetarian or intolerant of some ingredients. If the drug's half-life is important to you. For example, if you are concerned about withdrawal effects and would prefer a drug with a longer half-life. For information about what the half-life means and why it matters, see our page about medication half-life. If you are worried about certain side effects of your medication. Remember: drugs don't work the same way for everyone, and it's important to find a medication that works for you.  Antipsychotics by generic name and key characteristics.

"Withdrawal from antipsychotics. There may also be reasons that you want to stop taking antipsychotics. For example, you may be experiencing unpleasant side effects. Or you may want to try other ways of coping with your mental health. Some doctors may suggest that you keep taking antipsychotics for some time. This is usually to reduce the risk of your symptoms coming back. But you may feel that this is the wrong choice for you. This page covers: How easy is it to come off antipsychotics? When should I come off antipsychotics? What withdrawal symptoms might I get? Will my psychotic symptoms come back?   I feel so much better being off – less drugged up and more alive. How easy is it to come off antipsychotics? Some people may be able to stop taking antipsychotics without problems, but others can find it very difficult. If you have been taking them for some time, it can be more difficult to come off them. This is especially if you have been taking them for one year or longer. If you are considering stopping taking antipsychotics, it is worth thinking about the following: It is safest to come off slowly and gradually. You should do this by reducing your daily dose over a period of weeks or months. The longer you have been taking a drug for, the longer it is likely to take you to safely come off it. Avoid stopping suddenly, if possible. If you come off too quickly you are much more likely to have a relapse of your psychotic symptoms. It may also increase your risk of developing tardive psychosis. Get support from people you trust. Ideally this will include your doctor or psychiatrist. It also includes getting support from friends and family. And you could try peer support to find support from others who have had similar experiences to yours. Unfortunately, your doctor or psychiatrist may not support your decision to come off antipsychotics. This may mean they don't offer as much help as you would like. Our page on support for coming off psychiatric drugs has information about other ways to find support. Remember : whether to continue or stop taking medication is your decision, and you have the right to change your mind. I took myself off and found I could feel emotions again, which was scary, but worth it. When should I come off antipsychotics? There's no perfect time to try coming off antipsychotics. Everyone is different, and there are many factors that might affect your experience of coming off. If you are considering when to stop your medication, it might help to think about the following: What else is going on in your life right now? If you're under lots of extra stress, will this affect your ability to cope? For example, you may feel more stressed than usual if you are moving house, experiencing financial worries or concerned about your family. Would you prefer to feel relaxed and unburdened while you come off your medication? This may help you pay close attention to how you're feeling day to day. Or would you find it easier to be busy while you come off, so you're distracted by other things? Have you got a support group nearby or other people in your life who can provide any help you may need? If you've tried to come off your medication before but have not been able to manage it, what factors might have played a part then? Can you avoid or minimise them when you try again? Whenever you decide to try coming off, it is best to withdraw slowly and safely. It might take a long time, or you might find that you become comfortable on a lower dose and decide not to come off completely. The main thing is that you find a way to manage your symptoms that works for you. I came off them too fast and I wasn't physically or mentally ready for that. [I think] it's really important to make sure you come off them really slowly and under the watchful eye of a professional. What withdrawal symptoms might I get? The main withdrawal symptoms associated with antipsychotics are: abnormal skin sensations. aching muscles. anxiety. diarrhoea. dizziness and vertigo. feeling too hot or too cold. feeling withdrawn socially. headaches. loss of appetite. mood disturbances. nausea (feeling sick). neuroleptic malignant syndrome. restlessness, agitation and irritability. runny nose. shaking. insomnia (inability to sleep). sweating. tardive dyskinesia. tardive psychosis. vomiting (being sick). Unfortunately there is no evidence on how common these withdrawal symptoms are, so there's no way to know how likely you are to get any of them. Trying to come off was exhausting – my mood swings came back with a vengeance. Felt like I'd totally lost it again. Will my psychotic symptoms come back? Medication can help to stabilise your symptoms, so it's possible that your psychotic symptoms may return if you stop taking it. But it's not certain that this will happen. There are several factors that can affect whether you will become ill again. For example: You may have had other forms of treatment while you were taking medication, such as talking treatments and arts and creative therapies. These may have helped you find new ways to cope. You may have been able to make changes in your life since your last episode that mean you are less likely to become ill again. If you try to come off your medication too quickly, you are much more likely to have a relapse. Some psychiatrists believe that people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who take antipsychotics for several years are less likely to relapse than those who don’t take antipsychotics. But not all psychiatrists agree with this view. And a lot people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia also don’t find this to be true. I was on a very small dose so I found it easy to stop – no side effects. My energy levels are back, but I have noticed I'm not sleeping as much and I'm a bit edgy, so I'm monitoring myself closely using a sleep and mood journal."
"What are the alternatives to antipsychotics? If you don't want to take antipsychotics, there are several alternative treatments you can try. You may find it’s possible to manage your symptoms, or to make a full recovery, without medication. If you are taking antipsychotics, you may also want to use other options to support your mental health, as well as your medication. This page has information on some of the common alternatives to antipsychotics. You may find these helpful to use instead of your medication, or alongside it: Talking therapies. Arts and creative therapies. Ecotherapy. Complementary and alternative therapies. Peer support. Look after your physical health. In conjunction with antipsychotics, I have found that distraction techniques are a great way of dealing with troubling thoughts and voices in my mind. Anything and everything that is a distraction is ever so helpful for me, from painting my nails to baking a cake, from watching a DVD to colouring. Talking therapies. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that, for many mental health problems, you should be offered other kinds of treatments alongside or instead of medication. This often includes being offered a type of talking therapy or counselling , such as: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). See our A-Z of mental health for information about different mental health problems, including what types of treatment are recommended for each. Arts and creative therapies. Arts and creative therapies help you express your feelings through things like painting, clay work, music or drama therapy. They can help you deal with your symptoms, especially if you find it difficult to talk about how you’re feeling. Ecotherapy. Ecotherapy is a type of therapeutic treatment which involves doing outdoor activities in nature. This may include working on a conservation project or gardening. Or you may walk or cycle through woodland or other areas of nature. Complementary and alternative therapies. Some people find that complementary and alternative therapies help to manage their symptoms. For example, this may be aromatherapy, reflexology or acupuncture. Complementary therapies may also help manage some of the side effects of medication, if you decide to continue with it. Some herbal remedies can interact with antipsychotics and other types of medication. If you are thinking about taking a herbal remedy alongside any medication, speak to your doctor, psychiatrist or pharmacist about whether this is safe. I enjoy prayer and meditation as well as working at my local Food Bank. I also enjoy doing creative writing. Peer support. Peer support allows you to communicate with people who have similar experiences to yours. If you’d like to try peer support, you could: contact Mind’s Infoline or a local Mind to find out what support there is in your area. try an online peer support community, such as Mind’s supportive community Side by Side or Bipolar UK's eCommunity. Or you could try the Hearing Voices Network, if you hear voices or have other sorts of hallucinations. [What helps me is] running, healthy diet and Pilates. I also have friends and a support group that I trust. Look after your physical health. Think about what you eat and drink. Eating a balanced and nutritious diet may help to manage some of your symptoms. Drinking plenty of water can also help your mental wellbeing.  If you have a difficult relationship with food and eating, our pages on eating problems may help. Try to be more active. Many people find regular physical activity helps to lift their mood, boost their energy levels and keep them grounded in reality.  Try to get enough sleep. Getting enough sleep can sometimes feel difficult. But having a good amount of quality sleep is very helpful for your mental health. "
"What are anti-Parkinson's drugs? Anti-Parkinson’s drugs are mainly used to treat Parkinson's disease. They are not psychiatric drugs, which means they are not licensed to treat mental health problems. But your doctor or psychiatrist may prescribe one of these drugs alongside an antipsychotic, to reduce certain side effects from the antipsychotic. These are known as neuromuscular side effects , as they affect your body’s neuromuscular system. The effects may also be known as Parkinsonism, as they are similar to some of the effects of Parkinson’s disease. These effects include: your muscles becoming stiff and weak. developing a slow tremor (shaking), especially in your hands. your mouth hanging open and dribbling. There are three anti-Parkinson's drugs which may be prescribed alongside antipsychotics to reduce these symptoms: procyclidine. trihexyphenidyl (formerly called benzhexol). orphenadrine. These anti-Parkinson's drugs are sometimes known as antimuscarinics. Antimuscarinic is the term used for the group of effects that these drugs have on your body. There are no significant differences between these three medications. But you may find that one of these drugs works better for you than others. When might I be prescribed an anti-Parkinson's drug? You should only be prescribed an anti-Parkinson's drug if you have developed Parkinsonism symptoms as a side effect of your antipsychotic, and you can't switch to a different antipsychotic or reduce your dose, or. you have tried changing the antipsychotic or reducing the dose, but this has not helped your Parkinsonism symptoms. These drugs should never be prescribed to prevent side effects that you haven’t already experienced. What are the risks with these drugs? Anti-Parkinson’s drugs are used to reduce certain side effects of antipsychotics. But they can also cause side effects of their own. See our information on procyclidine, trihexyphenidyl and orphenadrine to find out about the possible side effects of each drug. These drugs also have a stimulant effect. For some people, they may cause an addiction. When you stop taking anti-Parkinson’s medication, you should reduce your dose gradually. Otherwise your Parkinsonism symptoms may return. You may decide to stop taking anti-Parkinson’s drugs and antipsychotics around the same time. In this case, guidelines suggest to come off the antipsychotic first, and then stop the anti-Parkinson's drug. You should be especially careful about taking these drugs if you have: a heart condition. high blood pressure. liver disease. kidney disease. You should avoid these drugs if you: have glaucoma (a serious eye condition), or are at risk of developing it. are showing signs of tardive dyskinesia. have myasthenia gravis (a rare, serious muscle disorder). have an enlarged prostate. are pregnant or breastfeeding. This is because there's very little information on how safe these drugs are, and babies are sensitive to antimuscarinic effects. About procyclidine. Trade names: Kemadrin.

There are many different types of talking therapy , but they all aim to: give you a safe time and place to talk to someone who won't judge you. help you make sense of things and understand yourself better. help you resolve complicated feelings, or find ways to live with them. help you recognise unhelpful patterns in the way you think or act, and find ways to change them (if you want to). Is there a difference between 'therapy' and 'counselling'? Throughout these pages we've chosen to use the term 'talking therapy'. But you might also hear people talk about: counselling. therapy. psychotherapy. psychological therapy. talking treatment. Usually there's very little difference between what's meant by these terms – they all broadly refer to talking therapy (as opposed to other types of treatment, such as drug therapy). But sometimes they might indicate differences in who your therapist is , or refer to a specific type of talking therapy . Sometimes it’s hard to talk to family and friends and you just need that one person who takes the time to listen. What can therapy help with? Therapy can help you manage and cope with: Difficult life events, such as bereavement (losing someone close to you), or losing your job. Relationship problems. Upsetting or traumatic experiences, whether it's something recent or something that happened a long time ago. Difficult emotions, such as grief, guilt, sadness, confusion, anger and low self-esteem. Depression and anxiety. Other mental health problems. Talking therapies can help with a range of diagnoses, and specific talking treatments have been developed for some mental health problems. Long-term physical health problems. Some people think that therapy is an extreme option, and that unless things get really bad you should try to manage on your own. But this isn't true. It's ok to try therapy at any point in your life, whatever your background . In fact getting support from a therapist when you're not at crisis point can be really helpful – it might feel easier to reflect on what's going on, and could help you keep things from getting worse. For me, counselling was a lifesaver. I never used to talk to anyone. For years, I would keep things bottled up and then cry hysterically on my own as to not inconvenience anyone. I would hide it so I wouldn’t have to confront my thoughts and fears. Could therapy work for me? Talking therapies have been shown to work well for many people. And some types of therapy are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as evidence-based treatments for particular mental health problems (such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) for borderline personality disorder.) But it's difficult to say whether a particular therapy will work well for you or not because it depends on lots of factors, including: what you want help with. your relationship with your therapist. your feelings about therapy generally. The importance of your relationship with your therapist Research has shown the relationship you have with your therapist is really important in how successful you find any talking therapy. Regardless of the type of therapy they practice, if you don't like or trust that person you're less likely to feel able to open up to them, and are less likely to have a positive experience. Therapy can work well on its own, or it can be something you try alongside other treatments, including exercise or medication (see our section on therapy, medication or both? for more on this). But therapy isn't a quick fix, so it might take some time to see whether it's helping you or not. And it isn't right for everyone. If you've tried therapy for a while and it hasn't helped, it's important not to blame yourself . Our pages on getting the most from therapy and alternatives to therapy offers options and tips for a range of situations. You’re the only person who knows which treatments work for your mental health – counselling doesn’t work for everyone, neither does mindfulness or medication."
"What different therapies are there? Talking therapies can differ in: their focus (for example, learning about more yourself by talking about your past, or working on overcoming a specific problem you have now). the techniques the therapist might use during sessions. the academic theory behind them. Common types of therapy. Therapists use all sorts of complicated words to describe their particular style of therapy, which can be really confusing. Also, many therapists are trained in several different styles and will tailor their approach for you. In this case they might also use words like ' eclectic ', ' blended ' or ' integrative ' when they describe how they work. Here are some common terms you might come across when describing different types of therapy, and what they mean: Arts or creative Uses creative processes such as painting, drawing, drama and music as a way to help explore and communicate difficult or confusing feelings – such as in arts and creative therapies . Behavioural Explores the way you act. Cognitive Explores your thoughts and the way you think – such as in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . Dialectical Explores opposite positions and looks at how they might exist together – such as in dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) . Humanistic Focuses on the individual as a whole, including mind, body, spirit and soul. Mindfulness-based Involves becoming aware of all your current thoughts and feelings and accepting them. Often involves mindfulness techniques, such as meditation and breathing exercises. Person-centred Focuses on using your own strengths and insight about yourself to encourage personal growth and improve relationships. Psychoanalytic (or analytic) Focuses on unconscious, deep-rooted thoughts that often stem from childhood. Psychodynamic (or dynamic) Explores how your unconscious thoughts might affect the way you act. Solution-focused Focuses on what you want to achieve in the future rather than exploring past experiences. What types of therapy are available near me? It's important to be aware that not all therapies are available everywhere . Sometimes it can feel like you don't have much choice, as it may largely depend on what's available locally. It might help most to learn what's available to you personally, and think about how to get the most from therapy in any situation. Find out more. The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) website has an extensive A–Z of therapeutic approaches . This list covers many types of therapy by name, and explains the different beliefs and approaches behind each one. Don't be disheartened if the first talking treatment you try doesn't help. It took me three attempts to find the right therapy for my anxiety and six to find the right one for my post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – the right treatment is out there."
"This page covers: What is CBT? What does CBT treat? What are CBT sessions like? How can I get CBT? Can I do CBT by myself? What if CBT doesn’t work for me? What is CBT? Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy . It’s a common treatment for a range of mental health problems. CBT teaches you coping skills for dealing with different problems. It focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and actions. CBT is very good for helping me not listen to my self-critical voice, which is so damaging. I still get anxious. But CBT helped me gain insight and perspective. It was the start of my journey to recovery, though not the only part. What is the theory behind CBT? CBT is based on the idea that how we think about situations can affect the way we feel and behave. For example, if you interpret a situation negatively, you might experience negative emotions. And those bad feelings might lead you to behave in a certain way. CBT combines two types of therapy to help you deal with these thoughts and behaviours: Cognitive therapy, examining the things you think. Behaviour therapy, examining the things you do. CBT got me through a really tough time. From being suicidal and off work, to functioning again. It reintroduced structure to my life when I'd given up. What does CBT treat? CBT is a common treatment for many mental health problems and experiences, including: Anger problems. Anxiety and panic attacks. Bipolar disorder. Depression. Drug or alcohol problems. Eating problems. Hoarding. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Perinatal mental health problems. Phobias. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Psychosis. Schizoaffective disorder. Schizophrenia. Self-harm. Sleep problems. Stress. Sometimes you might be offered an adaptation of CBT to treat a mental health problem. Some adaptations of CBT for specific problems might have a slightly different name. For example, you may be offered trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT) to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . Or CBT for physical health problems, if you experience a mental health problem alongside a physical health problem. Stepped care If you’re offered NHS treatment for your mental health, CBT might be the first treatment you’re offered. If CBT doesn’t work you may then be offered other types of talking therapy or counselling. This approach is sometimes called stepped care. It means you might need to try CBT first before you can get other treatments. CBT is learning to stop the cycle of negative thinking. I still have relapses now and it's the one tool I use to get me out of the truly dark spots. What are CBT sessions like? In CBT you work with a therapist to identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviour. You and your therapist might focus on what is going on in your life right now. You might also talk about how your past experiences have affected you. CBT is usually a short-term treatment where you have a set number of sessions. This may vary depending on your local area or therapy service, and the reason you’re having CBT. It can be daunting when faced with a list of things you can't do. But CBT helped me break up my goals into manageable chunks. During the sessions. A typical CBT session may include: Working through exercises with your therapist to explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviour. Agreeing some activities to work on in your own time. Going over what you did in previous sessions and discussing what progress you’ve made. Outside the sessions. CBT can involve activities for you to do outside your sessions with a therapist. This might include filling in worksheets or keeping a diary. You may need to commit your own time to complete the work over the course of treatment. You may also need to continue this after the treatment has ended. You can find out more about how CBT works on the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) website, including information in different languages. How CBT helped me find happiness. CBT has helped me build up resilience, gain self-belief and enjoy life as much as I can. Read Kasey's story How can I get CBT? Speak to your GP and they can refer you for CBT through the NHS for free. Some charities or workplaces may also offer free access to a CBT therapist. In England, you may also be able to: Refer yourself via the NHS talking therapies programme. Search for CBT and other talking therapies on the NHS mental health services finder. NHS waiting lists for CBT can be long, so you may decide to see a therapist privately if you can afford it. You can find accredited CBT therapists through the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) . CBT for depression and anxiety. I've noticed myself referring back to things I was taught in CBT. Read Sophie's story Can I do CBT by myself? You may want to try doing CBT by yourself, either through books and worksheets or online. This could be useful to try if you’re waiting for treatment. Or it might remind you of some good techniques, if you’ve had CBT in the past. Some CBT treatments aren’t suitable to try on your own . In particular, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that computerised CBT should not routinely be used to treat specific phobias . You can also talk to your doctor or healthcare team about whether it might help to do some CBT by yourself. They might be able to: Recommend books, for example from the Reading Well series of self-help books. Suggest worksheets or other resources that could be helpful for you to try. Give you access to an online CBT service. Mental health apps. There are various apps available that you could use to help yourself day-to-day. But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. Would you like some recommendations? We've put together a library of safe apps that meet our high quality standards. I had previously tried CBT when I was first diagnosed, which I didn't find helpful. However the second time I tried it, it completely changed my life. What if CBT doesn’t work for me? Although some people find CBT helpful, not everyone does. If it hasn’t worked for you on one occasion it may still work at another time or with another therapist. Or it may be that other types of therapy or support suit you better. See our information on what to do if therapy isn’t helping and alternatives to therapy for other options you could try. I was encouraged to try CBT again with a different therapist. I like this one and am getting on much better. Which therapist you have makes a big difference. Print this page"
"This page covers: What is DBT? What does DBT treat? How can I get DBT? What are DBT sessions like? Can I do DBT by myself? What is DBT? Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of talking therapy . It's based on cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT) . But it's specially adapted for people who feel emotions very intensely. The aim of DBT is to help you: Understand and accept your difficult feelings. Learn skills to manage these feelings. Become able to make positive changes in your life. 'Dialectical' means trying to understand how two things that seem opposite could both be true. For example, accepting yourself and changing your behaviour might feel contradictory. But DBT teaches that it's possible for you to achieve both of these goals together. Through learning various skills from DBT, I can ride the waves of my depression rather than letting them swallow me. What's the difference between DBT and CBT? CBT focuses on helping you change unhelpful ways of thinking and behaving. DBT does this too – but it also focuses on accepting who you are at the same time. After a few months I found that, although how I felt and a lot of my symptoms did not change, I was managing them all so much better. I could actually get through days without a crisis. What does DBT treat? DBT was originally developed for borderline personality disorder (BPD) . But research shows that DBT can also help with problems like: Self-harm. Suicide attempts. Depression. Drug and alcohol problems. Eating problems. But everyone experiences therapy differently. Whatever your diagnosis or problems, DBT might not be right for you . DBT is more likely to work for you if: You feel able to do homework between sessions. You're ready to focus mostly on your present and future, rather than your past. You feel able to do some sessions in a group with others. Some people like group work, but others find it harder. You might prefer to work with a DBT therapist one-to-one. But unfortunately this is not always offered as an option. You can talk to your doctor or mental health team about what you would find most helpful. But the options in your local area may be limited. I was really nervous about the group aspect of DBT. When I started group I wouldn't speak or make eye contact, but everyone was supportive and by the end I was much more confident and even taught a skill session to the other group members. How can I get DBT? The main ways to seek DBT are: Through the NHS, with a referral from your doctor or mental health team. With a private therapist. But accessing DBT can be difficult . It isn't available everywhere. NHS waiting lists can also be very long in some areas. Especially if there is high demand for the service. And many of us can't afford to pay for a private therapist. If you'd like to access DBT, these pages may help: If you want to access DBT on the NHS, our information on how to find NHS therapy explains how to ask your GP for a referral. If you want to find private DBT, our information on paying for private therapy has links to directories where you can search for private therapies. Some therapy directories include filters for types of therapy or mental health problems. The Counselling Directory includes a filter specifically for DBT under 'type of therapy'. My DBT journey. I see a future for myself now that I didn’t see before the therapy. Read this story Do I have to accept my diagnosis to get DBT? DBT was developed to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD) . So you might be more likely to be offered DBT if you accept this diagnosis. But personality disorders are a controversial diagnosis . If you don't like the idea of using this term, you're not alone. It might help to remember that however you understand your problems, DBT could help you manage them. At first it was really tough, and I wondered what the point of it was going to be. Some of the DBT skills seemed silly to me, but I had committed myself to the process and as time passed, it started to make more sense. What are DBT sessions like? DBT can vary between different providers and across different areas. But these are the types of sessions that a DBT course usually includes: DBT pre-treatment add remove Some therapists may offer you an assessment or pre-treatment phase of DBT. This is where the therapist will look at how suitable DBT is for you. They might offer you several sessions where you'll learn about DBT. Then if you decide it's the right therapy for you, they'll ask you to make a commitment to the treatment. Individual therapy add remove Individual therapy usually involves weekly one-to-one sessions with a DBT therapist. Each session lasts approximately 45 to 60 minutes. The sessions have these goals, with the first being the most important: To help keep you safe by reducing suicidal and self-harming behaviour. To reduce behaviour that interferes with therapy. To help you reach your goals and improve your quality of life by addressing what's getting in the way. This might be mental health problems like depression or hearing voices. Or things in your personal life, like employment or relationship problems. To help you learn new skills to replace unhelpful behaviour and help you achieve your goals. Your DBT therapist is likely to ask you to fill out diary cards as homework, and bring them to sessions. This is for you to track your emotions and actions. And to look for patterns and triggers in your life. You then use this information to decide together what you will work on in each session. You can find some sample diary cards on the DBT Self Help website . I’ve learned that emotions are not the enemy. They are useful and have functions. I still feel emotions intensely, but I can now identify them and know how to manage them without using harmful behaviours. Skills training in groups add remove In these sessions, DBT therapists will teach you skills that you apply in your day-to-day life. You will be part of a group, but it is not group therapy – more like a series of teaching sessions. There are typically four types of skill training: Mindfulness. This is a set of skills that focus your attention on the present, rather than worries about the past or the future. DBT sessions may often also start with a short mindfulness exercise.  Distress tolerance. This means learning to deal with crises without harmful behaviour, like self-harm. Interpersonal effectiveness. This is a set of skills to help you better manage relationships and learn to deal with conflict. Emotion regulation. This is a set of skills you can use to understand, be more aware, and have more control over your emotions. In group sessions, your therapist might ask you to do group exercises and use role-play. You are also given homework each week to help you practise these skills in your day-to-day life. Telephone coaching add remove DBT often uses telephone coaching to support you in your day-to-day life. This means that you can call your therapist for support between sessions. For example: When you're trying to use DBT skills and want some advice on how to use them. When you need help to deal with an immediate crisis, such as feeling suicidal or wanting to self-harm. If you need to repair your relationship with your therapist. But you can expect your therapist to set some clear boundaries around this. For example: Calls are usually brief, often between 5 and 15 minutes. Calls should only take place during hours you both agree to. In some situations, they might ask you to wait 24 hours before calling them. During DBT sessions, therapists will use a balance of acceptance and change techniques: Acceptance techniques. Acceptance techniques focus on: Understanding yourself as a person. Making sense of why you might do certain things, such as self-harm or misusing drugs. For example, a DBT therapist might suggest that this behaviour has been your only way of coping with intense emotions. So your behaviour makes sense, even if it might cause damage or alarm other people. Finally someone is saying 'yes it makes sense' rather than 'no that's wrong'. Change techniques. Change techniques focus on replacing behaviour that harms you with behaviour that helps you. This may mean your therapist: Challenges your unhelpful thoughts. Encourages you to find new ways of dealing with distress. It's not a short term thing. You have to work at it every single day. It's hard to do, and even now, some 2 years after I completed the therapy, I’m still having to work at it. Can I do DBT by myself? It can be difficult to learn DBT techniques by yourself. It can also be overwhelming when you start doing DBT. So doing it by yourself doesn't usually work as well as going to sessions run by trained therapists. Doing a formal course of DBT can help you: Stay motivated if you feel like giving up. Find situations where you can practise DBT skills. Feel supported and less alone, as others in the group are going through the same process. But you may be able to find DBT self-help materials online, such as on the DBT Self Help website. This might include diary cards, exercises and behavioural analysis sheets. You could use these to work on your DBT training alongside a formal course, or after finishing one.

"This page covers: What are arts and creative therapies? What can they treat? What are the different types of arts and creative therapies? How are they regulated? How can I access arts and creative therapies? What if they don't work for me? What are arts and creative therapies? Arts and creative therapies are treatments which involve creative activities within therapy sessions. They use different art forms, such as drawing, music or dance. And they're provided by a trained professional. You don't need to have any art skills. And people of any age can benefit from them. Different people will have different experiences of arts and creative therapies, but in general they aim to: Allow you to communicate thoughts and feelings that you find difficult to put into words. Help you make sense of things and understand yourself better. Give you a safe time and place with someone who won't judge you. Help you find new ways to look at problems or difficult situations. Help you to talk about complicated feelings or difficult experiences. Give you a chance to connect with other people. Therapy sessions can take place in a one-to-one setting, or in a group. A range of settings provide them. This includes charities such as local Minds , day centres, hospitals and private therapists. Art therapy lets you express feelings you can't find words to explain. You talk through the image with your therapist and communicate through it, taking the pressure off. What can they treat? Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that arts therapies are considered for everyone who has psychosis or schizophrenia . This includes related conditions such as schizoaffective disorder . Research suggests that arts and creative therapies may help with other mental health problems. But it's difficult to be sure, because many studies have included only small numbers of people. More research is needed. Arts and creative therapies may help if you find it difficult to put your thoughts and feelings into words. They may also help with addressing painful feelings or experiences of trauma . Some people find that doing a creative activity with their therapist helps put them at ease. It can also make the session feel less intense. It helps when I struggle to find the words, when I'm too angry, despairing or confused to know what I think. It gives me a voice. What are the different types of arts and creative therapies? The main types of arts and creative therapies in the UK are: Art therapy. Dance movement psychotherapy. Dramatherapy. Music therapy. Art therapy. Art therapy involves using art materials. For example, you might use pens, pencils, crayons, paint, chalk, clay or collaging. You might also use digital media, such as photos or video. You don't need to have any art skills or experience. With support from your therapist, you might use art materials to express your feelings or experiences. And your therapist might sometimes provide ideas or prompts. For example, some art therapy groups focus on a particular theme or activity each session. Your therapist won't judge your art or tell you what it means. They'll help you explore what it means to you and how you felt about making it. For example, you may talk about why you chose a particular colour or material in your artwork. But not everything you make will need to have a meaning. Some people find that art therapy helps them to: Communicate feelings or thoughts they find difficult to talk about. Look at a problem or situation in a new way. Explore difficult or painful experiences. Understand themselves better. Feel more comfortable in therapy. Find out more from the British Association of Art Therapists (BAAT) . Art has been a healing tool. It helps soothe my nervous system and gather my attention, even if just for a moment. My sketchbook is my safe space. Read Katie's story Dance movement psychotherapy. Dance movement psychotherapy (also known as dance therapy) involves using body movement and dance. For example, you might explore different types of movements and rhythms. You don't need to have any dance skills or experience. Some people find that dance movement therapy helps them to: Feel more in touch with their body and physical surroundings. Address difficult feelings about their body or appearance. Explore difficult experiences through movement rather than words. Find out more from the Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy UK (ADMP UK) . The therapists were able to tell a lot from what you'd created. It helped open up topics for conversation. Or get a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions out of your head. Dramatherapy. Dramatherapy involves using different types of drama and performance activities. For example, you might invent characters, tell stories, play games or do mimes. You might also use puppets, masks or other objects. Not all activities will involve talking, and you don't need to have any acting skills or experience. Some people find that dramatherapy helps them to: Express or resolve difficult thought or feelings. Safely explore being playful and using their imagination. Explore how mental health problems affect their body. Find out more from the British Association of Dramatherapists (BADth) . It allowed me to use my imagination for something positive. Music therapy. Music therapy involves exploring music and sound. You don't need to have any musical knowledge or experience to do it. For example, you don't need to know how to play any instruments, read music or be a good singer. Together with your therapist, you might listen to music or use different types of instruments to explore ways of communicating and expressing your feelings. Music therapists often provide instruments that are easy to use, such as cymbals, wood blocks or bells. Or you might use your voice to make sounds or sing.

"What to expect from therapy. It's common to feel worried or unsure about what to expect from therapy. This page covers: Who might my therapist be? What should happen the first time I see a therapist? What might the therapy sessions be like? What will I talk about in therapy? Will everything I tell my therapist be confidential? How will I feel after a therapy session? Who might my therapist be? Your therapist might describe themselves in various ways, such as: Counsellor. Wellbeing practitioner. Therapist (or psychotherapist). Psychologist (or clinical psychologist). Psychiatrist. All of these titles should mean that the person you see is trained in delivering therapy. Although they may differ in their educational backgrounds and levels of training. But whatever their title and level of training - it matters that the person delivering your therapy is someone you feel comfortable talking to. What should happen the first time I see a therapist? Some therapists might call your first session a 'taster session', a 'consultation' or an 'intake session'. But these generally involve the same thing. Your first session is for setting expectations and starting to build trust between you both. Your therapist should clearly explain to you: Their background and qualifications. Which professional body they're registered with. Their confidentiality policy. The type of therapy they provide, and how it could help you specifically. Their experience working with people who have similar problems to yours. How long the therapy will last, and how many sessions they can offer. What to do if either of you need to miss or cancel a session. Their fees, if they charge fees - but therapy is free on the NHS. They may also invite you to sign an agreement to show that you understand and agree to the therapy they can offer. They should also give you space to explain and discuss: What you want to get out of therapy. Any accessibility needs you have. Any worries or concerns you have about therapy. If you're unsure about any of these things it's ok to ask your therapist questions at any time. They should answer you openly and honestly. Checking your therapist's credentials It's good practice for any therapist to be a registered member of one of the professional bodies listed in our useful contacts page. This means they've signed up to meet certain standards of practice. You can usually double check this through the membership body's website. My first session was bit of a blur – I had no clue what to say. I think I mainly just cried and apologised! But it got easier over time when I realised that my counsellor wasn't going to laugh at me or tell me to go away. What might the therapy sessions be like? How sessions are structured can vary depending on depending on the type of therapy you're getting and the type of problem you want help with. Therapy can be: Time-limited, meaning your therapy will come to an end after a set number of sessions. Most therapists through the NHS offer time-limited sessions. Open-ended, meaning it can continue for as long as you need it. This is something that is more commonly offered by private therapists. Sessions can be delivered: Individually, with just you and your therapist. In a group with others who are having the same therapy. With your partner or family members. In a combination of individual and group sessions. One-to-one sessions typically last between 50 minutes and an hour , but group sessions can sometimes be longer. It's common for sessions to be held once a week , but you might also agree to see your therapist more or less often than this. Sessions may take place: In an appropriate meeting room owned or rented by your therapist, or by the organisation providing the therapy. Over the phone or online using an internet calling software. At your therapist's office or home, if you're having private therapy. What will I talk about in therapy? What you might cover in your therapy sessions varies. For example, your therapist may go through specific exercises with you. Or you might have a more general discussion about how you're feeling. They may ask you questions about: Your current and past relationships. Your childhood and past experiences. Situations or events you find difficult. How you feel. How you behave. What you think about things. Issues that have come up in previous sessions. But it's important to remember that you don't have to talk about anything you're not ready to talk about , or do anything you don't want to do.  Will everything I tell my therapist be confidential? In most cases, yes. Confidentiality is an important part of building trust with your therapist. But there are some exceptions, which help your therapist work responsibly. Your therapist's supervisor Therapists always discuss clients regularly with a supervisor, who also has to keep your confidence. This person should be another experienced therapist. It's seen as unethical for a therapist to work without supervision. This is because: It helps your therapist look after their own mental health, so they're better able to support you. It means someone else is aware of how your therapist is treating you, to make sure it's appropriate. Other professionals where they work If your therapist is part of a GP practice, confidentiality may apply to the practice as a whole. This is called organisational confidentiality. This may mean that information about you is available to your GP. Your therapist should tell you if this is the case. Your safety If your therapist believes that you're at serious risk of harming yourself or someone else, they may need to inform your GP, a healthcare professional or someone else. They should tell you first if they're going to do this. Under 18? Our guide on understanding confidentiality for 11-18 year olds explains how and when information about your mental health is kept private. How will I feel after a therapy session? It's common to feel a range of emotions after a session. For example, you might come out of your session feeling: Relieved, if you've shared something important and felt heard and understood. Energised, if you've started to understand something new about yourself or set yourself a new goal to work on. Exhausted, if you've found the session challenging or hard work. Frustrated, if you didn't get what you wanted out of your session or haven't felt heard or understood. Upset or overwhelmed, if the session has brought up very painful or difficult memories or feelings. Sometimes therapy sessions can bring up feelings that are difficult to cope with, and you might feel nervous about going back, or like you want to quit. If you feel like this it can help to: Start your next session by telling your therapist how you felt after your last session, and give them a chance to reflect with you and offer support. You might find it helpful to write down some notes. Talk about how you feel with a listening service or someone you trust, such as friends or family. Plan something you enjoy for straight after each session as a little treat, or to help you relax. Some days I left therapy feeling tired and drained. Other days I felt relieved, as if a weight had been lifted. If you feel unsafe after a session If therapy is bringing up feelings that you can't cope with and you feel like you're in crisis after a session, contact a crisis service and seek urgent help . Some therapists might be able to offer emergency support outside sessions, but many can't. You should ask them about this during a session, and make sure you know what their boundaries are before calling them in a crisis."

These are positive steps you can take to get the most out of any type of therapy you are offered: Make sure talking therapy is the right choice for you just now It could help to ask yourself beforehand: Am I ready to explore my feelings and behaviour?

If you have therapy face-to-face, these are some things you could try to make the sessions feel more comfortable: Make the room feel more comfortable and safe For example, you could ask to change where you sit, or adjust the lighting or the temperature of the room so you feel more relaxed. Take something in with you to help you ground yourself For example, this could be a treasured item or something you can fiddle with. Have someone you trust nearby, if you want It could help you relax if you know someone will be there to meet you when the session is finished. Tips for phone and online therapy. Many of us may have therapy over the phone or online, rather than face-to-face. Some of us prefer this, particularly if it’s difficult leaving the house or using transport. But some people worry that it will be harder to have an open and honest conversation if they have therapy remotely. If you feel like this, this may feel especially hard if you’ve had face-to-face therapy in the past but this isn’t currently possible. These are some tips to help make your sessions feel more comfortable: Make a plan with your therapist Try to talk to your therapist before the session. These are some things you could discuss: Whether you can choose between a phone or video call, and which one you would prefer. The confidentiality of your sessions, and how your personal data will be used. It’s the responsibility of the therapist to make sure that any digital platform they use is secure. What number your therapist will call you from if you’re having your session by phone. Or whether the therapist will withhold their number. They sometimes do this to respect your privacy, for example if you don’t want their number showing on a shared phone bill. Who will restart the call if you lose connection. This can be common, but usually only lasts for a short amount of time. How long the session will last, particularly if you have problems looking at a screen for a long time. Any reasonable adjustments you might need, for example if you would prefer to turn your camera off for a video call. Or if you would like to have someone you trust with you during the session. Any other worries you have about the session. Ask for help with setting up your call If you’re unsure about how to use video calling technology, ask a friend, family member or someone else you trust to help set this up. Age UK has a guide to using video calls , which may also help. Think about where you'll have the session If you can, try to find a place in your home where you won’t be disturbed. If you’re worried about being heard by people you live with, using headphones for the session may help with privacy. Or you could ask your therapist if it would be possible for you to talk to them while you’re out for a walk. Choose somewhere away from home, in a safe space for you. It might also help to turn off any digital notifications such as social media or text messages, to avoid getting distracted. Think about how to relax during the session For example, you could hold a comforting object or take a moment to focus on your breathing. Think about what you'll do after the session Your session may bring up difficult emotions. To help manage this you could try and plan a relaxing activity, such as listening to your favourite piece of music, before going back to your usual routine. If you’ve had your therapy session in your home, you might want to take some time away from the room where this took place. Spending some time in a different room may help you wind down after the session. Or go outside for a short while if you're able to. You may want to let someone you trust know that you’re having the session, so that they can check in with you afterwards. Be kind to yourself It can take time to build trust and feel comfortable with a therapist. This could feel even more difficult when you’re not seeing them face-to-face. Try to be kind to yourself if it takes time to get used to having therapy in this way. If you're finding it hard to feel comfortable, it may help to tell your therapist exactly how you're feeling. This might feel daunting, but it may help to increase your sense of connection because you've been able to be honest. Dealing with therapy coming to an end. It's common to have a mixture of thoughts and emotions about finishing therapy. It's likely to depend on the experience you've had and the relationship you've formed with your therapist. There's no one particular way you're supposed to feel. If you're worried about how you'll cope, tell your therapist how you're feeling. They might be able to help you plan things you can do after your therapy has ended to help yourself, think of alternatives to try , and work out your next steps.

Asking your GP or the NHS service if there is another therapist you can work with. Finding another therapist, especially if you are accessing therapy privately.

"What alternatives are there to therapy? Although many people find therapy helpful, it's not for everyone. If therapy isn't right for you just now, or you're currently on a waiting list, or you just want more options to explore, you could try: Self-help books. Your GP might recommend particular titles from a Reading Well scheme called 'Books on Prescription'. This scheme is supported by most local libraries, so you can go and check the books out for free – you don't actually need a prescription from a doctor. Peer support. This brings people together who've shared similar experiences and can empathise with what you're going through. (). Ecotherapy. This is the general name for a wide range of programmes which focus on incorporating nature into therapeutic activities, such as gardening, being outdoors or working with animals. (). Complementary and alternative therapies. These include options such as yoga, massage, meditation and herbal remedies. (). Medication. There are various medications you doctor might offer to prescribe you which can help reduce the symptoms of different mental health problems. You might sometimes be offered medication alongside therapy. Our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem , self-care and mental health support services also cover different options that might be available to you. Therapy, medication or both? In some situations your doctor might offer you either therapy or medication alone, or often both together. This might be because: Medication could help you get more benefit from therapy, as it can ease your symptoms so you're better able to explore your thoughts and feelings. Medication is often something you could try right away, whereas you might have to be on a waiting list for a while before you can get therapy through the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) might recommend a particular treatment path for your diagnosis, which includes medication. Whatever you're offered, it's important to remember that: What you find works best will be personal to you. Different medications and therapies work differently for different people. You might have to try a few things to work out what helps you most – and you might find that different combinations suit you better at different times in your life. It's your choice what treatment you want to try, and you usually have the right to refuse medication or therapy if you don't want them.  Mental health apps. There are various apps available that you could use to help yourself day-to-day. But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. Would you like some recommendations? We've put together a library of safe apps that meet our high quality standards."

"What are complementary and alternative therapies? Why might I try them? Can they treat mental health problems? Do they work? Are they safe? How are they regulated? What else should I consider before starting a therapy? Where can I get complementary and alternative therapies? What if they don't work for me? What are complementary and alternative therapies? Complementary and alternative therapies cover lots of different treatments. These include body-based therapies, meditation-based therapies and herbal remedies, among others. The NHS offers some of these. Others are based on different ideas of healing and wellbeing than those we normally hear about in the UK.  What's the difference between a 'complementary' and an 'alternative' therapy? Whether a therapy is 'complementary' or 'alternative' will depend on how you use it as part of your treatment. In general: 'Complementary' describes treatments which you may use alongside other treatments. 'Alternative' describes approaches that replace the treatments offered by your doctor. One person might use a certain therapy as complementary alongside things like medication, while another person might use the same therapy as an alternative to medication. There are some misconceptions about complementary and alternative therapies. Some people think they don't work properly, are a scam, or have no evidence behind them. This is not always true, but the lack of information and clinical research on them can make it difficult to know which ones might work for you. As advised by my doctor, I take an SSRI antidepressant every day, in conjunction with supplementing iron, B vitamins, no alcohol before my cycle and avoiding caffeine as much as possible. Why might I try them? There are many reasons you might decide to try complementary or alternative therapies. For example: You don't want the treatment your doctor has offered, such as psychiatric medication or talking therapies. You've already tried the treatments your doctor has offered and they haven't suited you. For example, you haven't found a psychiatric medication that works, or it's caused unwanted side effects. You're on a waiting list for treatment, but you need help to manage your symptoms right away. You want more options to try in addition to the treatments your doctor has offered. You don't agree with your doctor's approach and you want to take another approach to looking after your mental health. Whatever your situation, if you have any worries about your mental health you can seek advice from your GP . When I could no longer take SSRI antidepressants due to side effects, I tried St John's wort as an alternative. It's definitely helped with my depression and my mood has lifted quite a lot. Can they treat mental health problems? Complementary and alternative therapies can be used as a treatment for both physical and mental health problems. Different therapies are used for different mental health problems. In general, there is more research on these therapies for sleep problems , depression and anxiety . But there has been some research on how certain treatments might help other mental health problems. Our page on types of complementary and alternative therapies has more information on what each treatment might help with. I noticed that a large part of my anxiety was down to the fact that I wasn’t breathing properly. Yoga helped with this immensely. Do they work? As with all therapies, different things work for different people. There's not much clinical evidence for these therapies, so your GP isn’t likely to prescribe them. But a lot of people do say they find them helpful in managing mental health symptoms, so in this sense they can work. Some research into how they work suggests this could be showing the placebo effect. This is when we feel better after taking a remedy because we expect it to make us feel better. This effect can happen with sugar pills that have no active ingredients. But it can apply to other treatments as well, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines. Whether or not a remedy has a clinical effect doesn't always matter – the outcome of feeling better can be very real and meaningful in our lives. For more on the effectiveness of different therapies see our pages on: types of complementary and alternative therapies​. herbal remedies. Exercise became a big part of my routine to keep anxiety at bay. Along with mindfulness techniques and medication. Are they safe? Most complementary and alternative therapies are considered safe when provided by a trained and experienced practitioner. However, there may be times when a certain therapy may carry higher risks for you, and would not be recommended. For example, if: you are pregnant or breastfeeding. you are receiving any other treatments that could interfere with the therapy. you have a physical or mental health problem that could be made worse by the therapy. you are about to have surgery or another medical procedure. Before you start any new treatment it is a good idea to talk through any safety concerns with your doctor and your treatment provider . This is especially important if you're already taking any kind of medication. If you are considering taking a herbal remedy, see our information on when herbal remedies might be unsuitable for you . Remember that your local pharmacist can also give you advice about prescription and over-the-counter medications. How are they regulated? There's no compulsory regulation for most complementary healthcare practitioners in England and Wales, so it is possible to practise without regulation. However, there are several kinds of voluntary organisations that practitioners can choose to register with: The Complementary & Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC). The CNHC acts as a voluntary regulator for the sector. It publishes a list of registered therapies, and maintains a public register of practitioners who have signed up. Professional associations for particular types of therapies. These are membership organisations which provide a range of benefits and services for practitioners, and act in the interests of the profession. Most have their own codes of practice and registers of practitioners. It's always a good idea to choose a therapist who is registered with a regulatory body or professional association. This means they have met the standards of practice and education required by that organisation. For guidance on the regulation of herbal medicines, see our information on how herbal remedies are licensed . What else should I consider before starting a therapy? Only you can decide whether a type of treatment feels right for you. But it might help you to think about: What do I want to get out of it – is it realistic? What does it cost – can I afford it? How long will it take – have I got enough time? Is it open-ended or time-limited? Will I have to travel? Have I got any health problems that would affect me being able to do the therapy? Am I receiving any other treatments that would affect me being able to do the therapy? Could this therapy be adapted to meet my needs? Would someone I trust be able to come along with me if I didn't feel comfortable going on my own? Finding the right therapist. As with any kind of therapy, it's really important to find someone you feel confident and safe with. Whatever the kind of therapy or medicine they practise, if you don't like or trust that person you're less likely to have a positive experience. As a good starting point, your practitioner should be able to give you straightforward answers to your questions about: what qualifications they have. what professional bodies they're registered with. their past experience of using the therapy for your specific problem. what risks might be involved, and what you should do if you experience any negative effects. what procedures they have in place for making a complaint. proof of insurance. any other concerns or questions you have about the therapy. If you don't feel able to ask these questions of them beforehand it might help to write them down in an email, or ask someone you trust to come along to support you. Where can I get complementary and alternative therapies? To find a registered therapist you can: use the search tool on the Complementary & Natural Healthcare Council website (CNHC). look for a list of practitioners through an organisation who specialises in the particular therapy. You can find links to these organisations on our page on types of complementary and alternative therapies. You may also find a recommendation for a local therapist through: alternative therapy centres. health spas. your local Mind branch. your GP practice. your local community centre. Can I get them through the NHS? While there are some complementary and alternative therapies available through the NHS, you can't always get them for mental health problems. This is because there is currently not enough evidence to show how effective they are for mental health, so the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare - cannot recommend them. However, NICE does recommend that healthcare professionals take your values, thoughts and preferences into consideration when they are planning your treatment. This means that, while a treatment might not always be available on the NHS, your doctor should still be able to talk to you about alternative options and how they might interact with other treatments, so that you can look for them outside the NHS if you want to. To find out what the NHS is able to offer you locally, it's a good idea to make a GP appointment and ask your doctor directly. What if they don't work for me? Although some people find that complementary or alternative therapies can be helpful, not everyone does. If you've tried something and it hasn't helped, it's important not to blame yourself. Managing a mental health problem can be really difficult, especially when you're not feeling well. It can take time and may not be straightforward. But many people find that when they find the right combination of treatments, self-care and support, it is possible to feel better.  Print this page"

If you want to learn about a therapy that isn't listed here, ask your doctor if they have any information on that particular type of therapy and if it might be right for you. A lot of the research that has been done on these therapies suggests they are most effective when used alongside other treatments , rather than being enough on their own. Do not stop taking any medication or other treatment you have been prescribed without talking to your GP or healthcare professional first. Safety information. Most complementary and alternative therapies are considered safe when done by a trained and experienced practitioner. However, there may be times that that a certain therapy carries higher risks for you. For more on safety see our information on are they safe , when a herbal remedy might be unsuitable for you and things to consider before staring a therapy . Some treatments may impact your fitness to drive . Speak to your GP or pharmacist about this if you're worried. 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan). What is it? 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is something our bodies naturally produce to help them form serotonin (a brain chemical involved in our mood). 5-HTP can also be taken as a supplement you can buy in health food shops and some pharmacies. What is it used for? Depression and sometimes anxiety. Are there side effects and is it safe? The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting and headaches. However, taking too much 5-HTP or taking it with antidepressants can cause serotonin syndrome. If you have bipolar disorder 5-HTP may also cause mania or hypomania . Does it work? Studies have shown that 5-HTP can work as well as antidepressants for some people. Some people may also feel the positive effects faster than with other antidepressants. However, more research needs to be done into the long term use of 5-HTP and not everyone finds it helpful. You should always speak to your GP or pharmacist before considering taking 5-HTP. L-tryptophan. 5-HTP is made in our bodies from the amino acid tryptophan. We can get tryptophan from the food we eat. L-Tryptophan is also available as a tablet that some people use for depression . However, L-Tryptophan has been linked to a very serious health condition called Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS). EMS causes fatigue, muscle weakness and pain, skin changes and breathing problems. It can be fatal in some cases. L-Tryptophan is still available in the UK, but only with a prescription. There have been no reports of people getting EMS when taking 5-HTP, but more research needs to be done. Acupuncture. What is it? Acupuncture involves inserting very fine needles into specific parts of your body. This is believed to stimulate nerves and muscles which may release natural pain-relieving chemicals. It is practiced in both Western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. What is it used for? Depression , anxiety and sleep . Acupuncture is often used to relieve chronic pain, which might be contributing to anxiety, sleep problems or low mood. Are there side effects and is it safe? Sometimes people experience pain, bleeding or bruising where the needles puncture the skin. You should speak to your doctor before getting acupuncture if you are taking medication or have a health problem that impacts blood clotting, or if you have an allergy to certain metals. Acupuncture should be done by a professional, such as a doctor or registered practitioner. Does it work? It is not clear whether acupuncture is helpful for mental health problems on their own, but some people find it useful in managing symptoms or as part of self-care. Acupuncture is a recommended by the NHS for migraines and chronic pain, and some people with chronic pain find that acupuncture helps with their mental health. Where can I find out more? British Acupuncture Council. British Acupuncture Federation. NHS information on acupuncture. Alternative medical systems. What are they? There are some traditional treatments that take a different approach to healthcare than that taken by the NHS. These approaches include Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ayurvedic Medicine, Siddha Medicine and Unani Medicine. In some countries, these approaches are part of mainstream medical care. They often have different ideas to those found in UK healthcare about the causes of mental health problems, how to identify them and how to treat them. The treatments include other complementary and alternative therapies, such as herbal remedies, massage and acupuncture . What are they used for? Alternative medical systems are used to treat a range of mental health problems. Are there side effects and are they safe? These approaches involve a wide range of practices and treatments, which will have different side effects, and there can be risks in some treatments. You should speak to your practitioner or GP about these before deciding to have any treatment. Do they work? Treatments in alternative medical systems have different amounts of evidence behind them. A lot of research on these practices is done in other countries and there is not always a good understanding of the theories behind them in the UK. However, some people find these approaches helpful, particularly if they are from a country where these practices are more common. If your mental health problem is not getting better or is getting worse after using these treatments, it is important to speak to your doctor. Where can I find out more? Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ATCM). Ayurvedic Professionals Association (APA). Aromatherapy. What is it? Aromatherapy uses essential oils (oils extracted from plants) for healing. It can also be combined with other treatments, such as massage therapy . Some people use essential oils themselves, or products with essential oils such as candles. What is it used for? Different essential oils are thought to be useful for different experiences. For example, lavender oil is commonly used for relaxation and sleep. Other oils may be helpful for different experiences. Are there side effects and is it safe? It is possible to experience allergies or reactions to the oils, so you should speak to the aromatherapist beforehand if you have concerns. Does it work? Many people find aromatherapy helpful as part of a self-care routine or for managing symptoms alongside other treatments . It is unlikely to be able to treat a mental health problem on its own. Where can I find out more? Therapy Directory information on aromatherapy. I like calming essential oils like lavender dotted about on soft furnishings and clothes. Cannabis-based medicines. What are they? Cannabis-based medicines cover a wide range of substances, including medical cannabis and cannabidiol oil (CBD oil). Medical cannabis must be prescribed by a qualified healthcare professional. It is only prescribed for certain conditions, mainly for people recovering from chemotherapy, some types of epilepsy, and chronic pain. CBD oil, on the other hand, is available to buy legally from health food shops and pharmacies. It does not contain large amounts of THC (the part of cannabis that makes you ‘high’). However, most CBD oils will contain a small amount of THC, and different brands will include different amounts. What are they used for? Depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Are there side effects and are they safe? Medical cannabis can cause behaviour changes and hallucinations , while CBD oil may cause fatigue and changes in appetite. Neither of these are recommended for those of us who experience psychosis or have schizophrenia , because THC can make symptoms worse. Possession of non-medical cannabis is illegal in the UK. Do they work? There is evidence to support that CBD oil and medical cannabis can be helpful for anxiety , but there is still a lot we don't know about how it works. CBD products are all made differently, which means they might not all work for you. It's currently unlikely that you'll be able to get a prescription for medical cannabis for anxiety, unless no other treatments have worked. Where can I find out more? Food Standards Agency. NHS information on medical cannabis and cannabis oils. NICE guidance on cannabis-based medicines. Talk to Frank. Herbal remedies. Herbal remedies are substances that come from plants, which are used as a way of treating and preventing different health problems. See our guide to herbal remedies for detailed information on these.

I really like the smell too, which feels comfy and helps me sleep. Homeopathy. What is it? Homeopathy involves using extremely diluted (watered down) natural substances to treat physical and mental health problems. Homeopaths believe that the more a substance is diluted, the more effective it will be. What is it used for? Some people find that trying homeopathic remedies for stress , anxiety and depression does make them feel better. Are there side effects and is it safe? There are no major side effects associated with homeopathy, however there is a risk that if you chose this as your main or only treatment, your mental health problem might get worse. Some ingredients used in homeopathy can also interact with other medications. Does it work? There has been a lot of research into homeopathy and there is no evidence to suggest that homeopathy can treat any health conditions. Some people find that they feel better while having homeopathy, but there is no evidence that homeopathy was the cause of this improvement. The NHS no longer provides any homeopathic services because of this. If you are considering homeopathy, it is recommended that you also consider other treatments, as it is very unlikely to work on its own. Where can I find out more? Federation of Holistic Therapists (FHT) information on homeopathy. NHS information on homeopathy. Society of Homeopaths. Hypnotherapy. What is it? Hypnotherapy involves being put in a deeply relaxed state by a hypnotherapist. There are different types of hypnotherapy and different ways to be hypnotised.

Many people find it useful in managing symptoms of anxiety , phobias , stress , anger , addictions , and compulsions in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) . Some people find it helpful for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but it is important that this is supported by a qualified professional and potentially alongside other treatments , otherwise it can make your symptoms worse. Are there side effects and is it safe? Hypnotherapy might not be suitable for you if you have a diagnosis of personality disorder or psychosis (it may make your symptoms worse), or if you are due to be a witness at a trial . Does it work? Hypnotherapists use hypnosis to help you change unwanted thoughts and behaviours. They do this by using suggestion and by supporting you to increase your self-awareness. It can be helpful for helping change behaviour, but not everyone feels comfortable being hypnotised, or finds that it works for them. Where can I find out more? Complementary & Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) information on hypnotherapy. Federation of Holistic Therapists (FHT) information on hypnotherapy. National Hypnotherapy Society. NHS information on hypnotherapy. Light therapy. Light therapy uses a strong light to simulate sunlight and lift mood. For information on light therapy see our page on treatments for seasonal affective disorder . As well as being used for seasonal affective disorder, some evidence suggests it might also be helpful for depression and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder that happen during times of less sunlight. Using a light box wasn't perfect but the change was tangible. A real shift. I began to cope better with the dark days and didn't have the all-encompassing desire to get back into bed and stay there. Massage. What is it? Massage involves working on the soft tissue of your body to help with relaxation, wellbeing and physical pain. There are lots of different types of massage therapy, such as Shiatsu, Indian head massage, sports massage and aromatherapy massage. What is it used for?

You can get most essential vitamins and minerals from a balanced diet, but some of us take supplements if we have a deficiency or think it might help with a particular health problem. What are they used for? Vitamins and minerals play an important role in our general health. Some mental health problems can be caused be a deficiency in vitamins and minerals, and taking supplements or increasing how many nutrients we get in our diet can help. There is also good evidence to suggest that taking omega-3 fatty acids alongside mood stabilisers can help if you're experiencing depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder. Are there side effects and are they safe? The vitamins and minerals you get in supplements can be found naturally in foods, and that is normally the best way to take them. Having too many supplements can be harmful to your health. If you are considering taking supplements, speak to a pharmacist or GP. Do they work? Unless your mental health problem is caused by a vitamin or mineral deficiency, they are unlikely to be enough on their own to help your mental health problem.

Weighted blankets are safe and there are no significant side effects. You may find them uncomfortable if you do not like physical touch or experience claustrophobia. Do they work? Studies on weighted blankets for anxiety are relatively new, but they are positive. Many people find them helpful in managing their anxiety symptoms or panic attacks . I’ve used a weighted blanket when I’m struggling with anxiety and it does really help. I think it tricks your mind into thinking someone is hugging you. Like you’re being taken care of. Yoga. What is it? Yoga involves spiritual and physical practices designed to increase self-awareness. These include posture work, breathing exercises, meditation , sounds and visualisation. There are many different types of yoga that suit a range of fitness levels. What is it used for? Many people use yoga as part of general self-care, but it can also be effective for anxiety , stress and depression . Are there side effects and is it safe?

"This page covers: What are herbal remedies? What are they used for and do they work? How are they different from psychiatric drugs? How are they licensed? When might they be unsuitable for me? What is a herbal practitioner? What are herbal remedies? Herbal remedies are substances that come from plants. They come in various forms, such as capsules, teas, liquid drops or skin creams. You can get them at health food shops, supermarkets, pharmacies and from herbal practitioners . Some may be referred to as 'supplements'. Others may be referred to as 'medicines', which means they aim to treat, cure or prevent a diagnosed health problem. Often herbal remedies are part of alternative approaches to healthcare , such as Ayurvedic medicine and Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). What are they used for and do they work? There are lots of different types of herbal remedies that aim to help with different health conditions or help with your wellbeing . Some of the most common ones in the UK are: chamomile, lavender or valerian remedies for sleep and relaxation. St John's wort for depression. chaste berry for PMDD and premenstrual syndrome. Not all herbal remedies have been researched equally, and some have more scientific evidence to show how they work than others. However, many people find certain herbal remedies help them as part of self-care or managing symptoms. I enjoy chamomile tea. I tend to drink it when stressed, anxious, or wanting to try wind down and relax. I do find it helps, because hot drinks are soothing. I really like the smell too, which feels comfy and helps me sleep. How are they different from psychiatric drugs? Unlike psychiatric medication , most herbal remedies are: based on long-standing traditional use (not based on scientific research studies using clinical trials). available to buy over-the-counter without a doctor's prescription. not typically offered by NHS doctors (because there is not enough reliable evidence that they are effective at treating mental health problems). licensed under a different licensing scheme. occasionally prepared 'bespoke' (specifically for you based on your needs) by a herbal practitioner. I like calming essential oils like lavender dotted about on soft furnishings and clothes. Are they safer to take than psychiatric drugs? Some people assume that herbal remedies must be safer than psychiatric drugs, or less likely to cause side effects. But this is not necessarily true. Herbal remedies can cause side effects and can interact with other drugs , just as prescription drugs can. If not prepared correctly, some may be toxic. So you should approach any kind of supplement or medication with equal caution (prescription and non-prescription), and make sure you have all the information you need to feel confident about your decision. If you are in any doubt about whether a medication or herbal remedy is safe for you to take, seek advice from your GP or local pharmacist . If you experience any side effects from herbal medicines, you can report these to the Yellow Card scheme . How are they licensed? Products that contain herbal ingredients are licensed differently depending on whether they are considered a: herbal medicine, such as St John’s wort. food, such as some herbal teas. cosmetic, such as skin creams that contain herbal ingredients. Bespoke herbal remedies , which are prepared by herbal practitioners, are not licensed. Herbal medicines sold in supermarkets, pharmacists and health shops in the UK are licensed by the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) . Even though this is the same organisation that licenses other kinds of drugs, including psychiatric medications , herbal medicines are covered by a different registration scheme. This is the Traditional Herbal Medicines (THR) Registration scheme . Under this scheme, a medicine can be registered without going through clinical trials (like they would for prescription drugs). It just needs to show that it: has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time. is only used to treat minor health conditions. All licensed herbal medicines should be marked with the registration mark shown here: This indicates that the herbal medicine is safe to an acceptable standard, provided it is used according to the instructions on the packaging. It should also have a registration number, starting with the letters 'THR'. You can find a list of which herbal medicines have been licensed on the Gov.uk website. Some herbal ingredients are banned in the UK. You can find information on these on the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website. When might they be unsuitable for me? Although herbal remedies are easily available to buy without a prescription, some may not be suitable for you, or could be harmful. For example if you: have another physical or mental health problem which could be made worse by taking a herbal remedy, particularly a health condition that affects your kidneys or liver. are pregnant or breastfeeding. are taking any other medications, including psychiatric medications, as they may interact badly. are allergic to any of the ingredients. take too much, or don't take them as instructed on the packaging. are due to have surgery (some herbal remedies can interfere with anaesthetic). are buying your medication online (different countries have different rules on regulating herbal products and there are risks that the product could be fake, unlicensed or contaminated). take a remedy that is not licensed (for example, some unlicensed Traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic herbal medicines contain toxic levels of mercury and lead). Plants and herbal remedies can be fantastic. Just check in with the pharmacy if you're taking medications to be sure they won’t negatively impact medications you're taking. What is a herbal practitioner? Herbal practitioners play an established role in herbal medicine, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurvedic medicine. But currently there are no rules around who can call themselves a herbal practitioner. You can practise without having any related experience or qualifications. However, there are several voluntary registers which require certain standards of practice and education. So if you want to find a herbal practitioner, it's a good idea to find someone through one of these registers: National Institute of Medical Herbalists (NIMH). British Herbal Medicine Association (BHMA). Bespoke herbal preparations. After holding a consultation with you, a herbal practitioner may make you their own herbal preparation to take. Typically these are made from different parts of plants, minerals and sometimes metals. However, because these preparations are not licensed it's not possible to be sure what's in them, or in what dose. It is important to discuss any concerns with your doctor, pharmacist or herbal practitioner . For example, you might ask: what is in the preparation. how it might make you feel. what side effects you should expect. what you should do if you experience side effects that you were not told about. For more guidance see our pages on: what to know before taking medication. receiving the right medication for you. coping with side effects. the Yellow Card scheme (for how to report side effects from any medication, including herbal remedies).

Your doctor might consider it as a treatment if you experience: Long-term obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), if other treatments have not helped. Severe depression, if other treatments have not helped. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says DBS can be used to treat OCD, but only as part of a research study. This is because there is not enough evidence on how safe or effective DBS is. If your doctor suggests you could take part in a DBS study, they should explain the purpose and methods of the research to you. They should talk to you about the procedure, and any risks and side effects. They should answer any questions you have so that you can make the right choice for you, and provide informed consent . How does DBS work? The DBS procedure happens using anaesthetic. This might be with general anaesthetic, which sends you to sleep. Or it may be with local anaesthetic, where you are awake but a part of your body is made numb. Doctors will place electrodes in your brain through two small holes in your skull. Electrodes are insulated wires that conduct electricity. They will then put a stimulator under the skin on your chest. The stimulator is similar to a pacemaker. They connect the electrodes to the stimulator using wires under your skin. The stimulator then sends electric pulses through the electrodes to the brain. This stimulates parts of the brain. The electrodes and stimulator are left in place. The levels of stimulation can be adjusted or stopped. If you experience OCD, the aim of DBS is to reduce obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behaviours. You might find DBS helpful while the stimulation is turned on. But these thoughts and behaviours could return when it is turned off. DBS does not work for everyone. And it should only be considered if other treatments have not worked, for example talking therapy or medication . You may need to continue with other treatments alongside the DBS. What are the side effects of DBS? Possible side effects of DBS include: Infection after the operation. Complications if the equipment goes wrong, such as problems with the stimulator. Complications from the surgery itself, such as bleeding in the brain and seizures (fits). Increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Confusion or forgetfulness. Headaches. Sleep problems. Hypomania. Some side effects may go away or get better over time. Others may be longer-lasting. Your doctor should explain the possible side effects and how likely they are for you. Having the DBS implants may also mean that you cannot have electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) . Some people have reported experiencing suicidal feelings after DBS. But researchers don’t know if the surgery itself causes these feelings, or if they are caused by the mental health problem that was treated by the DBS. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. How can I access DBS? DBS is a rare treatment. It is not widely available in the UK. Doctors will only suggest it if other treatments have not worked. If you want to find out more about accessing DBS, you could discuss this with your doctor or mental health team. What should I think about before getting DBS? If your doctor recommends that you have DBS, these are some questions you could ask to learn more. Or you could ask someone you trust, or an advocate , to ask these questions for you: Why have you suggested DBS? What are its benefits? How likely is it that DBS will work for me? What are the risks and side effects? What does the operation involve? How long will I have to stay in hospital? What other treatment options are available to me? Have you offered me every other available treatment? What happens if DBS doesn’t work or something goes wrong? How long will it take me to recover from surgery? When will I feel the effects? What if DBS doesn't work? It might feel frustrating or disappointing if a treatment such as DBS doesn't work for you. Especially if you feel like you have tried lots of different things already. Try to not to blame yourself. And remember that different things work for different people. You could also talk to your doctor about other options you could try.

"This page covers: What is St John's wort and what's it used for? Are there side effects and is it safe? Does it work? What dosage should I take? Can I take it with other medications? Where can I get St John's wort? Will I get withdrawal symptoms from stopping? Where can I find out more? What is St John's wort and what's it used for? St John's wort is a herbal medicine used to treat mental health problems. The botanical name for St John's wort is Hypericum perforatum, and it is sometimes marketed and sold as 'Hypericum'. It contains many active substances, including hypericin and hyperforin, which are thought to affect mood. Today St John's wort is mainly used as an over-the-counter remedy to treat mild or moderate depression . Are there side effects and is it safe? Some research shows that people who take St John's wort have fewer, or less serious, side effects than with commonly prescribed antidepressant medications. There are also some people who take St John's wort and do not have any side effects. When I could no longer take SSRI's due to side effects, I tried St John's wort as an alternative. It 's definitely helped with my depression and my mood has lifted quite a lot. However, those who do have side effects most commonly report: feeling nauseous or being sick. diarrhoea. headaches. allergic reactions. tiredness. dizziness. confusion. a dry mouth. skin problems. increased sensitivity to sunlight. Some research also shows that St John's wort can increase symptoms of psychosis in those of us with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia . If you experience any side effects which you think should be reported, you can share your experiences with the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) via their Yellow Card scheme . Does it work? Research suggests that St John's wort works in a similar way to standard antidepressant medication, by increasing the activity of brain chemicals such as serotonin and noradrenaline that are thought to play an important part in regulating our mood. In some cases, St John's wort might be just as effective as some antidepressant drugs to treat mild or moderate depression . I found that St John's wort lifted my mood so I wasn't waking up at 5 am every morning. Life seemed more bearable. I saw colour. However, for severe depression there is little evidence to show that it can help, and very little evidence that it can help with anxiety or seasonal affective disorder (SAD) . In fact, some research suggests that it can make feelings of anxiety worse for some people. Experiences vary from person to person and more research needs to be done, especially into whether St John's wort can work over a long period of time. If St John's wort isn't right for you, there are other types of complementary and alternative therapies you can try. What dosage should I take? St John's wort is sold in a variety of different forms. The dosages available vary depending on the form and brand that you buy. It is most commonly sold as tablets and capsules. You can also get it as a tea, or as a liquid called a 'tincture', which you can take as drops in water. All medicines carry levels of risk in different circumstances, and can affect people in different ways. There is no standard recommended dosage of St John's wort in the UK and it is not currently clear what dosage works best. It is easiest to keep track of what dose you're taking if you take St John's wort in tablet or capsule form and if you stick to one particular brand. Be aware that if you buy a different type or brand, the dosage may be different or cause different side effects . My experience of St John's wort has been a bit negative. As it's a herbal medicine, you're never too sure if you're taking the right dose. If you are considering taking St John's wort, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist first to discuss what dosage would be best for you and check that it will not interact dangerously with any other medications you are taking. Before deciding what dose to take, read the packaging carefully and consider: How strong the product is. The packaging should give you an indication of this by describing the amount of hypericin or hypericum extract in the ingredients list or nutritional information section. How many times you should take the product each day. Directions should be given on the packaging. Tablets and capsules typically range from 1-3 times a day, depending on their strength. On the packaging of some products it might refer to the amount of St John's wort as 'aerial parts'. This just means the parts of the plant that grow above the ground. It's a good stop-gap solution to make you feel you're doing something to take control of depression. However, I've found the knock on effects of missing a dose to be worse than that of SSRIs. Can I take it with other medications? St John's wort has significant interactions with a large number of medicines which are in common use. This means that it may affect the way the body processes other medications, which may make them less effective, or increase the chances of harmful side effects. These medications include both prescribed drugs and medicines that you can buy for yourself over the counter. If you're taking, or considering taking, St John's wort at the same time as any other medications (prescription or over-the-counter), it is really important to get professional advice from a pharmacist or your doctor. They will be able to talk to you about any possible interactions St John's wort may have with your medications, and tell you about alternative treatments or dosages. For example, if you are taking any of the following drugs, speak to your doctor before trying St John's wort: antidepressants. antipsychotics. sleeping pills and anaesthetics. hormonal contraceptives (including emergency contraception). anticoagulants (drugs that thin the blood). immunosuppressants (drugs that prevent your immune system from damaging healthy cells). cholesterol and heart disease medications. blood pressure medications. migraine medications. epilepsy medications. cancer treatments. HIV and AIDS treatments. For a more detailed list of known medications that interact with St John's wort, you can visit the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. Where can I get St John's wort? St John's wort is available on prescription in many European countries. However, in the UK the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) do not currently recommend it, so doctors in England and Wales do not normally give prescriptions for St John's wort . This is because it's difficult to know what the right dose should be, preparations vary a lot and it has some potentially harmful interactions with other common medications. So while you can buy St John's wort over-the-counter at pharmacies and health food shops without a prescription, it is always best to seek advice from your GP first to make sure that it's safe for you. This way you can also talk about different treatment options and make sure you've understood them all before you make a decision. Will I get withdrawal symptoms from stopping? As St John's wort works in a similar way to antidepressants, it is important to take similar care in stopping them as you would with antidepressants. It is a good idea to slowly reduce your dosage , as this reduces the chance of withdrawal symptoms. This is especially important if you've been taking it for longer than a few weeks. If you are thinking about stopping taking St John's wort, it can be really useful to talk to your doctor about the safest way to withdraw. Some people stop taking St John's wort without any problems, while others experience withdrawal symptoms . Unfortunately, current information about withdrawal symptoms isn't very clear and more research needs to be done. Those who do experience withdrawal symptoms tend to report feeling sick, dizzy and tense during the withdrawal period, especially if they stop taking it suddenly without slowly reducing their dose. For tips on self-care while experiencing withdrawal symptoms have a look at our page on self-care during withdrawal . I had no side effects other than some photosensitivity and no withdrawal symptoms. Usually I am very side effect-sensitive so this was a great benefit. Where can I find out more?

These guidelines recommend using the following antipsychotics as mood stabilisers: haloperidol (Dozic, Haldol, Haldol decanoate, Serenace). olanzapine (Zalasta, Zyprexa, ZypAdhera). quetiapine (Atrolak, Biquelle, Ebesque, Seroquel, Tenprolide, Zaluron). risperidone (Risperdal, Risperdal Consta). The antipsychotic asenapine is also sometimes used as a mood stabiliser, as a treatment for mania. Are antidepressants mood stabilisers? Some people assume that antidepressant drugs are also mood stabilisers. This may be because they can help to lift your mood if you're experiencing depression. But antidepressants are not included in the group of drugs we call mood stabilisers. They are a separate type of psychiatric medication. "

But if you’re currently taking valproate, it’s important to continue taking it unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Find out about the planned changes . What are my choices? Mood stabilising drugs may carry risks of harm to your baby. You might need to think about your options if you take mood stabilisers and: you become pregnant. you're planning to become pregnant. you're breastfeeding. If you become pregnant, you will probably be asked to consider one of these options: Switch to an alternative drug which carries fewer risks, such as a low dose of an antipsychotic. Come off your medication. This should be done gradually, ideally with your doctor's guidance. If you are taking lithium, you might decide that you really need to continue with your lithium treatment. In this case your doctor should help you take careful steps to manage the risks of lithium to you and your baby. You will need to think about any possible risks to your baby from continuing with your medication. But also consider any possible harm from changing or coming off your medication.

This includes the right to choose whether or not to take medication, and to have your say in decisions about your treatment. Talk to a healthcare professional as early as you can. This could be with your doctor or midwife, or a mental health specialist. The earlier you start talking to someone about your options, the more in control you're likely to feel. For planned pregnancies, you should do this as soon as you decide you want to start trying to get pregnant. For unplanned pregnancies, you should speak to them as soon as you think you might be pregnant. Make sure you know the risks with each drug, so you can make an informed decision.

The risks to your baby with taking lithium while pregnant or breastfeeding are: Heart defects. Taking lithium in early pregnancy can increase the risk that your baby's heart might not develop properly. Your doctor or midwife should monitor your baby's heart using ultrasound scans. Increased risk of serious side effects and overdose. Being pregnant causes changes in your hormone levels, fluid levels and kidney function. All of these can affect the amount of lithium in your blood. You might not always realise when these changes happen. You may also have less control over your body as it changes during pregnancy. This can mean it’s harder to make sure your lithium level stays within safe limits. When you go into labour, both your lithium levels and your baby's lithium levels could become dangerously high. This is because the way your body clears lithium changes very suddenly during childbirth. If you breastfeed, there is a very high risk of passing on lithium to your baby through your breast milk. This could be dangerous to your baby’s health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has more information about taking lithium while pregnant or breastfeeding . Managing the risks with lithium If you decide it's best to continue with your lithium treatment, you and your doctor should take these steps to manage the risks: Regular lithium level monitoring. Your doctor will need to monitor your blood lithium level very carefully throughout your pregnancy to make sure it stays within a safe range. As a guideline, they should check your levels at least every 4 weeks, then weekly from the 36 th week of pregnancy. Your doctor may need to adjust your dose. This is because your kidneys clear lithium from your body differently when you're pregnant. You should give birth in hospital. This is because your obstetric team will need to monitor your lithium levels. Your obstetric team is the medical team who help to deliver you baby. The doctor who prescribes you lithium should speak regularly with your obstetrician about your treatment. Your obstetrician is the doctor responsible for delivering your baby. You should stop taking lithium as soon as you go into labour. Your obstetrician will need to carefully check your fluid and salt balance and the level of lithium in your blood throughout your labour. Your risk of postpartum psychosis If you've ever had a bipolar episode in the past, you have a much higher risk of developing postpartum psychosis in the weeks after you give birth. Because of this, your doctor might make these suggestions: You could continue taking lithium as long as possible during your pregnancy. This is to lower your risk of postpartum psychosis. If you've decided to stop lithium treatment during your pregnancy, you could start taking lithium again a few days after giving birth. You should discuss what feels right for you with your doctor. Anticonvulsants during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Anticonvulsant mood stabilisers carry the following risks to your baby: Anticonvulsant drugs may cause your baby to develop foetal anticonvulsant syndrome, if you take them while you are pregnant. Children who develop this syndrome can have physical defects and delayed development. They may need special educational support. The Organisation for Anticonvulsant Syndrome (OACS) has more information about foetal anticonvulsant syndrome on its website. If you breastfeed, anticonvulsant drugs could be passed to your baby through your breast milk. It's possible that your baby could experience some side effects from the medication. You should talk to your doctor about what feels right for you, before you decide to breastfeed. Each individual anticonvulsant drug also has its own risks. These risks are outlined below: Valproate Valproate carries the highest risk of danger to your baby out of all mood stabilisers. It can cause a number of different defects and symptoms in your baby. Together, these are known as 'foetal valproate syndrome'. They include: heart defects. spinal defects, such as spina bifida. face and skull malformation, including cleft lip. malformed sexual organs. extra, or deformed, fingers or toes. bleeding and liver disease. a higher likelihood that your child might be diagnosed with autism and learning difficulties. There is also some evidence that children may have a higher risk of developing symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The regulators of this medicine say that you should not take valproate if you are pregnant. They also say you should not be prescribed valproate if you are able to become pregnant, unless you have a pregnancy prevention programme in place.  If you are prescribed valproate, you should receive a patient booklet and patient alert card with your prescription. These will give you more information about the risks of taking valproate. Carbamazepine There is evidence that taking carbamazepine during the first three months of pregnancy increases the risk of your baby developing: heart defects. a cleft lip. a malformed penis. spinal defects, such as spina bifida. Lamotrigine Evidence on the safety of taking lamotrigine while pregnant is mixed. The NHS has information on taking lamotrigine while pregnant or breastfeeding . [While] I was on Epilim (sodium valproate)… I had a child born with various defects and she also has learning difficulties and GDD [global developmental delay] due to this drug. I was not told of the severe effects it can cause. Antipsychotics during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  This includes information on the antipsychotics that you may be offered as mood stabilisers. Further support during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Coming to a decision you feel comfortable with about what's right for you and your baby can be difficult. It's understandable if you feel conflicted or unsure about what to do. As well as talking to your doctor or a psychiatrist, you might find these support options helpful: Talk to someone you trust. If you feel able, it can help to talk through your feelings with someone you trust, such as a partner or close friend. Midwife appointments. You can talk to your midwife about how you're feeling throughout your pregnancy. They can also help make sure you receive plenty of support from your health visitor after you give birth. Perinatal mental health services. These services offer support to help you stay well during your pregnancy. You can be referred to these services by other professionals involved in your care, such as your doctor. Online peer support. It can be helpful to talk to other people who've had similar experiences to yours. Netmums has a supportive online network for all parents and parents-to-be. Bipolar UK has an online community for people with experience of bipolar disorder.  Specialist websites. Websites such as Action on Postpartum Psychosis, NCT and the Breastfeeding Network provide information and support on pregnancy, breastfeeding and mental health. The Independent Fetal Anti-Convulsant Trust (In-FACT) and the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome (OACS) offer support if you've been affected by taking anticonvulsant medication during pregnancy. You might also find it helpful to read our pages on parenting with a mental health problem . These pages include information on taking care of yourself, looking after your children, and other kinds of support available to parents."
"Coming off mood stabilisers. If you are taking mood stabilisers, you may think about how long to keep taking them for, and when to stop. If you decide to stop taking them, you may want to know how to do this in a safe way. This page covers: How long should I keep taking mood stabilisers? How can I come off mood stabilisers safely? How long should I keep taking mood stabilisers? How long you take mood stabilisers for will depend on many different factors. It should be an individual, ongoing decision between you and your doctor. You can discuss what works best for you and your symptoms, and any side effects you experience. You might prefer to take medication for many years if it helps you to feel stable and get on with your life. Or you might take medication to start with, but then develop other ways of coping. You may also have views on how long you'll need to take medication for, based on past experiences. These are some timings that your doctor may discuss with you: If you have bipolar disorder, you may be offered lithium for a longer period, to prevent or reduce your risk of relapse. Your doctor may suggest that you commit to taking lithium for at least six months, possibly longer. This is because it can take some time to make sure the medication is working effectively. If you are taking lithium and have not had a relapse in three to five years, it may be a good time to speak to your doctor about managing without your medication. You can also talk to them about the benefits of continuing with your medication, if you feel it is still working for you. If you decide to stop taking mood stabiliser medication, it is best to do this gradually. Once you have stopped completely, your doctor should continue to monitor how you feel for at least two years.

You should always carry this card with you and show it to any health professional before they treat you for any condition (including your dentist). a lithium record book. This is to help you and your doctor keep track of your blood test results and other details of your health. You can find detailed information about this drug in the official Patient Information Leaflet (PIL).

This scheme allows the MHRA to collect information about which drugs cause which side effects and how common they are. This lets drug manufacturers give more accurate information about their medication. Taking lithium safely. When you are prescribed lithium, the healthcare professional who prescribes it should explain how to take it safely. This includes letting you know its benefits, risks and side effects. They should also explain what the signs are if you take too much. This information explains some things that you can do to make sure that the level of lithium in your blood remains steady, within a certain range. If your lithium level drops too low, then the treatment probably won't work for you. If it rises too high it can become very dangerous, and could potentially be fatal. The information below explains how to: manage your dose. manage your fluid and salt levels. have regular blood tests. It's also important that you: know the possible side effects and signs of lithium overdose, and know what to do if you experience any serious side effects. It may help to let your family, friends or carer know the signs of taking too much lithium, if you are comfortable doing this. understand if any other drugs may interact with lithium, including over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen. If you have questions about this, speak to your doctor or pharmacist. keep your lithium information booklet and record book somewhere safe, and always carry your lithium alert card with you. understand the risks with taking lithium if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. understand the risks of stopping taking lithium too suddenly. Manage your dose The dose of lithium that you are prescribed will be personal to you, depending on several factors. These include: whether you are prescribed lithium citrate or lithium carbonate. whether you have just started your treatment, or if you have been taking lithium for some time. whether you are taking any other medication. your age and general physical health. If you have questions about your dose, speak to your doctor or the healthcare professional who prescribes you lithium. This includes questions about what to do if you miss a dose. Manage your fluid and salt levels The amount of salt and water in your body can affect your lithium level, so you'll need to manage your salt and liquid levels carefully. These are some ways to keep your fluid levels steady: Water – try to drink about the same amount of water every day. If you feel thirsty, have some water to avoid becoming dehydrated. The important thing is not to drink too much or too little compared to how much you would usually have. Caffeine – avoid sudden changes in how much you drink coffee, tea, cola or other caffeinated drinks. Caffeine makes you lose water, which can affect your lithium level. Other medication and alcohol – you should check with your doctor or pharmacist before you take any other medication or drink alcohol. This is because they may interact with the lithium in your body and and affect your lithium level. These are some ways to keep your salt level steady: Eating – don’t make sudden changes in the amount of salt you normally eat, and avoid fasting. You should speak to your doctor if you plan to start a new diet, especially if it is a low-salt diet. Sweating – try not to get into situations where you are likely to sweat heavily. For example, avoid saunas and sudden bursts of heavy exercise, and take it easy in hot weather. Sickness – you should tell your doctor if you have a high temperature, you are vomiting or you have diarrhoea. They might ask you to stop taking lithium temporarily, until you're better. Exercising – it's good to exercise regularly, provided that you're getting enough fluids and salt. But you should try to avoid taking your lithium dose just before doing vigorous exercise. Have regular blood tests Regular blood tests are important because they monitor the amount of lithium in your blood. This helps to make sure your dose is low enough to be safe, but also high enough that the treatment works. You might hear this test called: a lithium level test. a serum lithium level test. a plasma lithium level test. You should wait 12 hours after a dose before having a blood test, otherwise the reading might not be accurate. If you aren’t sure whether this is possible, for example if you take lithium twice a day, speak to your doctor about managing your doses. How often you should have a blood test depends upon where you are in your treatment: If you’re in the early stages of treatment or your dosage is being adjusted, you should have a blood test once a week. If your lithium levels have recently steadied after starting to take lithium or having your dosage adjusted, you should have a blood test once a month. If you've been taking a steady dose of lithium for a while and are confident with how to manage your lithium level safely, you should have a blood test once every six months. Your doctor may also ask for a blood level check if there are signs that your bipolar disorder is returning. This is to check if your lithium level is too low. Or they may ask for a blood level check if you start experiencing more unpleasant side effects. This is to check if your lithium level is too high.

"Why do some medications have different names? Any individual medication can have two kinds of name: A generic name. This is the drug's medical name, describing the active chemical in the drug. There will only be one generic name for a specific drug. A trade or brand name. These are names given to a drug by companies which manufacture the drug. Individual drugs can have several different trade names. For example, the antidepressant with the generic name fluoxetine is also known by the trade names Olena, Oxactin, Prozac and Prozep. These are all names for the same medicine, containing the same active ingredient. Whatever medication you are taking, it is useful to know the generic and trade names for a certain drug. This is because different people might refer to the same drug using different names."
"What do I need to know before I take medication? Before deciding to take any drug, it helps to have all the information you need to make an informed choice. As a start, you could use the following list of statements and see if you can answer 'yes' to all of them.

"How do I know if a drug is right for me? Medications can work in different ways for different people. It’s not always possible to predict exactly which drug will suit you. But there are things you can do to help find the medication that works for best you: Review your medication regularly. Your doctor or psychiatrist should give you a regular chance to talk about how you are getting on with your medication. For example, they should ask how you are feeling and whether the medication is helping. You can also discuss whether you are experiencing any side effects. Discuss any problems with your GP or psychiatrist. They might be able to offer you an alternative type of medication or treatment. Or they can advise you about how to manage your medication to reduce any problems. Ask for a second opinion. Sometimes you may feel worried or unsure about your diagnosis or treatment. You can ask your GP or psychiatrist to refer you to another healthcare professional for a second opinion. You have the right to do this. Pharmacists can give you information about your medication, for example about side effects. Most high street pharmacists have a private consulting room. This can help if you don't feel comfortable talking to them over the counter. You could take a list of questions with you to help remember everything you want to ask. Some drugs take a while to start working. You might need to take them for a certain period before deciding whether they are suitable for you. Remember: it is your decision whether or not medication is the right treatment for you. You have the right to change your mind. It took several trials of different medications at different strengths before the right combination worked for me."
"Could I ever be forced to take medication? In most cases, you cannot be forced to take medication.

You may be given medical treatment if it is assessed to be in your best interests.  Planning for a crisis. Some of us may worry about being forced to take medication if we become very unwell in the future. Remember: it is not common to be forced to take medication. But if you are concerned about this, it may help to plan for a future crisis while you are feeling well. This can help healthcare professionals know your wishes in advance, in case you lose capacity to make decisions about your own treatment. There are several ways in which to outline your future wishes, including: An advanced decision about any treatments you wish to refuse in future. This is a legally binding statement of instructions for healthcare professionals. An advance statement to outline your general wishes for future treatment. Advance statements are not legally binding. But they can still help healthcare professionals know your preferences for how you wish to be treated. "

In Wales, prescriptions for medication are free of charge. In England, some people need to pay for prescriptions, while others can get them for free. The NHS has a tool to check whether you can get help for the costs of any NHS treatment . This includes whether you may be entitled to free prescriptions. It also has a list of people who can get free prescriptions . If you are not entitled to free prescriptions, it may help to buy a prescription prepayment certificate .

This can work out cheaper than paying for individual prescriptions, depending on how many prescriptions you need per month. What if I run out of medication? If you run out of medication, the person who usually prescribes your drugs may be able to arrange a prescription for you. If that isn’t possible, you can ask a pharmacy for an emergency supply until you can get a prescription. To get an emergency supply of medication, you must have been prescribed the medicine before. And the pharmacist must agree with the following: You need the medicine immediately. The dose is appropriate for you to take. The pharmacist usually needs to see you face-to-face. And they usually need evidence that you have been prescribed the medication before. For example, this could be your last box of medication or most recent prescription. If the pharmacist gives you a prescription, they will make a note of the following details: Your name and address. The nature of the emergency. The date of the emergency supply. The name, quantity, form (such as capsules, tablets or liquid) and strength of the medication. If the pharmacist can’t prescribe an emergency supply of medication, they can still advise you on how to get any medical care you may need. The NHS has more information on where you can get an emergency supply of medication . If you need medication outside your GP or pharmacy’s usual hours, the NHS also has information on how to access out-of-hours medication . Medication shortages Sometimes there may be shortages of certain medications. Or certain drugs may be discontinued, which means they are no longer produced. If your medication is affected by a shortage, your pharmacist may be able to contact other pharmacies. They can check if your medication is in stock. It may help to take your prescription to a pharmacy before you actually need the medication. This gives the pharmacist time to order your medication from elsewhere before you run out. If you are in contact with a mental health service, they may also be able to help you find someone to give you your medication. If your medication is not available anywhere, you might be offered an alternative drug. For example, this may be the same type of medication, but a different brand. But this isn’t always suitable for everyone. If you are worried about shortages or whether your medication may not be available, you can discuss this with your GP or pharmacist."

Contact your GP or pharmacist right away, or call 999 for an ambulance. Do not drive or operate machinery. This includes driving to seek medical help. If you feel moderately unwell or very worried Get medical advice within 12 hours. Contact NHS 111 or see your GP or pharmacist. If you feel mildly unwell or uncomfortable Get medical advice in the next few days. Contact NHS 111 or see your GP or pharmacist. Or contact your nurse prescriber or care coordinator, if you have one. If you have only just started taking the medication, it may help to wait a few days to see if the side effects wear off. But if you are concerned, you can still speak to your GP or pharmacist or call NHS 111 for advice. When I first read the list of side effects of the medication I'd be taking, my first impulse was to flush it down the toilet. It was scary stuff. But I took it and I feel that medication has really helped me over the years. How likely am I to get side effects? The likelihood of experiencing different side effects varies for each drug. Your risk of experiencing a side effect is described in most PILs for specific drugs. It usually looks like this: Very common (affects more than 1 person in 10). Common (affects between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people). Uncommon (affects between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 people). Rare (affects between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 people). Very rare (affects fewer than 1 in 10,000 people). Not known (we do not know how many people are affected). In other words, if the risk is described as very rare (fewer than 1 in 10,000), that means 9,999 people out of 10,000 probably won't experience that side effect. This data is available for all newer drugs, but not for some older drugs. Can I report any side effects I experience? If you experience any side effects, you can report them via the Yellow Card scheme . This scheme collects information about the side effects of different drugs. It is a voluntary scheme, so you don’t have to report side effects if you don’t wish to."
"What is the Yellow Card scheme? The Yellow Card scheme collects information about the side effects of different drugs. It is run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The scheme exists for a few reasons: Making sure drug manufacturers list side effects accurately. For example, if lots of people report a side effect, manufacturers might need to consider how common it is. In some cases, they may need to add a warning to the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). Assessing whether a drug may need to be taken off the market. This may be necessary if enough people report a very serious side effect. Helping other people decide whether to take the drug in future by giving more accurate information about side effects. If you experience side effects after taking a particular medication, you can report them online through the Yellow Card website . Or you can get a report card from your pharmacist. You can also ask a healthcare professional to report side effects for you. The Yellow Card scheme is completely voluntary. You don't have to report any side effects you may experience, if you don't want to."

"What is a drug's half-life? The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for the amount of a drug’s active substance in your body to reduce by half. This depends on how the body processes and gets rid of the drug. It can vary from a few hours to a few days, or sometimes weeks. No matter what dosage of a drug you're on, or how long you've been taking it for, its half-life is always the same. Why does my medication's half-life matter? A drug's half-life matters because: a short half-life usually means more withdrawal problems. a long half-life usually means fewer withdrawal problems. If you are taking a drug with a short half-life and having problems with withdrawal, it might be possible for you to switch to a similar drug with a longer half-life. This longer half-life drug might be easier to come off. The half-life can also be a guide for how long a drug will take to reach a stable level in your body when you first start taking it. Generally, it will take about five times the drug's half-life to build a stable level in your body. Once a drug's level is stable in your body, any early side effects you experience from the drug may start to decrease. Where can I find the half-life of my medication? You can compare the half-lives of different types of drug by looking at our comparison tables for: antidepressants. antipsychotics. benzodiazepines. Z drugs and other sleeping pills. anti-anxiety drugs. The half-life given for any drug is not an exact figure. It can vary a lot between different people. These tables should only act as a guide."

If you don't find your medication helpful, you may wish to stop taking it. Or you may find it helps your mental health, but wish to stop for other reasons. For example: the side effects are more of a problem than any benefits you have found from taking it. you don't like the way medication affects you or how it makes you feel. your medication is stopping you from doing things you want to do. you don't like the idea of staying on medication long-term. you've been advised by someone you trust to come off your medication because it's not safe, for example due to side effects or a change in your symptoms. you've found other ways of coping or other treatments that help, which you feel are enough. your mental health has been consistently better for long enough that you feel you might not need the medication any more. Depending on your circumstances you may pay for your own prescriptions or you may get them for free. If you are thinking of coming off a medication because you can't afford it, there might be help available.  Is coming off medication right for me? The decision to come off medication is a personal one based on what feels right for you in your particular circumstances. After weighing up the advantages and disadvantages, you might feel that now is a good time to start coming off your medication. Or that you want to come off it in future but it's not the right time just now. Alternatively you might decide that your goal is to reduce your medication to a dosage that feels better for you rather than stopping completely, or that the medication is helping and you want to keep taking it. It's about deciding what's best for you at the moment, and remembering that what helps may change over time. My current doctor is great, and has always said that it is up to me if I take the medication or not, which makes me feel a lot better about it as I feel more in control. How do I start coming off medication? Before starting to come off your medication it's important to get medical advice and make a plan. For example: Get support It's important to get support before you start coming off. For example from your doctor, your mental health team or people with experience of coming off similar drugs. For more information see our pages on support services and useful contacts . Plan to come off slowly To come off your medication safely with less risk of relapse it is important to taper (slowly reduce) your dose.  Know your rights Whether to continue or stop taking medication is usually your decision. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) , the organisation that writes the guidelines on best practice in health care, say that: you have the right to be involved in decisions about medicines, so you can make an informed choice about your treatment. you have the right to refuse a medication or to stop taking it, even if your doctor thinks this might make your mental health problem worse. If you've agreed to take medication in the past you also have the right to change your mind.  Could I be forced to stay on medication?

On medication it was a lot harder to realise what made me feel worse, and what helped."
"How can I plan for withdrawal? Before coming off medication, it's important to make sure you have all the information and support you need to do it safely. This page covers some things you may want to consider when planning your withdrawal. You could also revisit these tips during withdrawal. Find out about your medication. Don't stop suddenly. Choose a good time to start. Talk to your GP or health care team. Make a tapering plan. Give yourself time. Come off one medication at a time. Tell people close to you. Plan ahead for difficult times. My experience of coming off medication. I would’ve liked more information and support when I did make the decision to come off my medication, especially about the side effects of withdrawal. Read Andy's story Find out about your medication. It can help to know as much as possible about any medication you're planning to stop taking. For example, if it's likely to cause particular withdrawal symptoms . It could help if you: Read the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). You can read the paper leaflet that comes with your medication, look in our A-Z of psychiatric drugs or search on the electronic medicines compendium (emc) – all PILs are available on this site and you should look for the particular form and dose you've been prescribed. If there is something in the information leaflet that you don’t understand you can ask your pharmacist or health professional to explain what this means. Talk to a pharmacist. You can ask them questions about medication without needing to make an appointment. For example, you could ask if different forms or doses might be available (such as changing from a depot injection or getting tablets in smaller amounts), so you have an idea of what could be possible to ask your doctor. Try peer support. It could help to ask other people about their experiences of coming off medication and what they found helpful. This won't tell you exactly what to expect as experiences vary from person to person even if you're taking the same drug, but it could give you some general tips and insight. For more information see support services, and read our information on peer support and online mental health. When searching for information on the internet, remember that some information about medication may be misleading or wrong. So be careful and make sure the information you read is written by a source you trust. Don't stop suddenly. Many people find that they become unwell if they stop taking medication suddenly. This is sometimes called 'going cold turkey'. It's not possible to tell who will be affected, so it's always advised that you slowly reduce your medication very slowly over a period of time. This is sometimes called tapering . Going slowly down to the dose you want to get to will give your mind and your body time to adjust to being without it. It’s important to do it gradually. Whenever I've suddenly stopped taking my medication, I end up feeling horrible and just back at square one. The main risks of stopping suddenly are: you are more likely to experience withdrawal symptoms. your original mental health problems are more likely to return or get worse. it can be dangerous for your physical health. Unfortunately going ‘cold turkey’ has for the most part been absolutely catastrophic and in the last instance ended up with me taking the highest level of completely new medications. Coming off valproate Different medications carry different risks. It can be very dangerous to stop taking valproate suddenly , so it's really important to talk to your doctor before trying to come off it. A doctor should only prescribe you valproate if you can make sure that you won’t become pregnant, through a pregnancy prevention programme. If you are taking valproate and think you could be pregnant, visit your doctor as soon as you can to get support.  Some drugs are particularly dangerous to stop suddenly if you have been taking them for more than a couple of months. These include clozapine (an antipsychotic), lithium and benzodiazepine tranquillisers among others. Choose a good time to start. Coming off medication can sometimes be difficult and, if so, it may be harder to do other things at the same time. It might help to think about when to start to withdraw. For example, it might help if you: wait until after any big changes or events you know are coming up. try to re-arrange stressful activities for another time, if you can. choose a time when you have enough other support in place. Often there won't be an ideal time to start coming off, but you might be able to think of times when it could be easier. For tips on looking after yourself during this time, see our page on self-care during withdrawal . I felt like a failure the first time I attempted withdrawal. It just wasn’t the right time. Be kind to yourself, be patient. Deciding to try it in winter was definitely a huge mistake! Longer days, sunshine and fresh air made all the difference. Talk to your GP or health care team. If you're thinking of coming off medication, it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor or health care team about why you want to stop, how you can do this safely and what additional support they may be able to offer to help you. Health professionals have a duty to support you with decisions you make about your treatment, even if they had previously advised you against stopping. This includes supporting you with coming off your medication safely. You can ask them about how to reduce it and any changes they could make to your prescription. For example, if smaller doses or a liquid alternative of your medication are available. Your GP can also help you cope with any withdrawal symptoms you experience, or suggest alternative treatments you could try. It can be helpful to book several GP appointments during the planned withdrawal period so that you can check in regularly with your doctor. With the GP’s advice I started to reduce the dose over time. I had more information about possible withdrawal symptoms this time. I experienced brain zaps, exhaustion, and feeling more anxious, but these symptoms subsided after a fortnight. Make a tapering plan. How you reduce your medication will differ depending on your medication and your own individual circumstances, which your doctor can advise on. In general though it will be important to reduce your dose slowly over time , by gradually taking smaller and smaller doses. This is called a tapering plan. It can help to write down your plan with timeframes showing the dates when you'll reduce your dose, by how much, and for how long. If you have a mobile phone, you may find the calendar function a useful way to plan your taper. Whichever method you use, you can adjust and change this as you go along depending on how you're feeling, but having a plan in place at the start can help reassure you and give you an idea of what you're aiming for. Taking smaller doses at the same regular intervals is generally safer than taking a larger dose and waiting longer until the next one. If you leave more time between doses, it can make chemicals fluctuate too much in your body and you may feel unwell. Ask your doctor, pharmacist or whoever normally prescribes your medication for help planning how best to reduce your dose. For example: Consider cutting or filing your tablets into smaller doses It can help to try cutting or filing your tablets into smaller doses. There are a few ways to do this. You may use a pill-cutter, which you can get at some pharmacies. Or if this doesn't allow you to cut off small enough pieces, some people find that using a small file, like a nail file, to shave a bit more off the tablet every day helps them to reduce their dose at a speed that feels safest and most manageable. Your doctor should be able to advise you on what to try, including whether this approach is effective with your specific type of medication (cutting or filing doesn't always work with slow-release medications). Consider asking for a liquid form of your tablets Some people find that liquid forms of tablets are helpful for coming off at a manageable and safe pace, as they allow you to drop down to lower doses slowly and sometimes more precisely than by cutting tablets. Liquid forms of tablets can be more expensive to produce so are not available for all medications though, so speak to your doctor to find out if this is an option for you. For more advice on how to take smaller doses by tablet or liquid form, speak to your GP, pharmacist or health care team. You may also find some of the organisations listed in our useful contacts can help you with this too. I have started and stopped medication many times. After the first time I was very careful with the antipsychotics and slowly tapered down whilst doing CBT. The psychotic episodes haven’t come back since. See our useful contacts page for a list of organisations that can help you learn about and plan for withdrawal, including opportunities to hear from people who have gone through it. Give yourself time. How long you need is different for everyone, and will partly depend on how long you've been taking your medication, the dose you take and the 'half-life'. The half-life is how quickly the drug starts to leave your body.  While it is sometimes possible to withdraw over a few weeks, it can be safer to do so over several months so that your body has a good amount of time to adjust. For some people who have been on medication for many years, withdrawing very slowly over a few years can also be helpful. Going very slowly is not only safer but can also help to reassure you if you are anxious about what it will be like to come off your medication, because it can give you a chance to adjust and see how you feel at lower doses. Life situations have a lot to do with how badly you respond to withdrawal. One time my tapering coincided with exams. I thought I could handle it (just wanted to get it over with) but it was too much stress. Waiting for a time where you aren’t expecting to be under a lot of stress is always a good idea! Come off one medication at a time. Which drug to reduce first will depend on what they are prescribed for, and how long you have been taking them. Medications often affect how other medications work, so if you're coming off one medication while also taking others your doctor might need to adjust your other doses to allow for how they affect each other. Tell people close to you. It could help to tell friends or family that you are planning to come off your medication. This might help them to understand what you're going through, and why you might seem different. You could also tell them how you would prefer to be supported if things become difficult. You might find that they don't understand why you want to stop taking medication, or that they disagree with your decision. It might help to talk together about their concerns, and to show them our information for friends and family . Plan ahead for difficult times. It could help to think about what you could do if things become really difficult, for example if you're experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms or the symptoms of your mental health problem come back. Planning for a crisis or a difficult time can feel scary, but it's a good idea to have things in place for if you need them. It can be reassuring for you and for those supporting you. You might also consider making an advance decision . If you become unwell while tapering down your medication, it is ok to change your mind and decide to stay on if you feel that actually this isn't the right time for you to go through withdrawal. See our planning for a crisis page for lots of ideas to help you plan ahead. Could I be forced to stay on medication? Generally it’s your right to choose whether you come off medication, but there are some situations where your right to choose may be affected. For example, if: you are sectioned (detained) under some sections of the Mental Health Act. you don’t have mental capacity to decide whether to have treatment, and the treatment is in your best interests.

"What are withdrawal symptoms? You may experience withdrawal symptoms (sometimes called withdrawal effects) while you're tapering or after stopping medication. This page covers: Will I get withdrawal symptoms? What type of withdrawal symptoms might I get? Am I having withdrawal symptoms or a relapse of my original illness? What could help with withdrawal symptoms? If you're experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms and need urgent help, see our page on getting help in a crisis . If you need to help someone else urgently, see our page on helping someone else in an emergency. Will I get withdrawal symptoms? Some people experience withdrawal symptoms and some don't. They can be very different person to person, lasting only a short time for some and a long time for others. It's not possible to tell who might get withdrawal symptoms when coming off medication, as it depends on many factors, including the type of medication you are on. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes be more likely if your medication has a short half-life, which means how quickly the drug starts to leave your body.  You are also more likely to experience withdrawal symptoms if you have been taking your medication for a long time, or withdraw from it too quickly. Some conditions make it more or less likely that you will experience withdrawal symptoms. For example, there is some research to show that if you have premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) you may have fewer withdrawal symptoms from antidepressant treatment than people who do not have this condition. This varies a lot person to person though so speak to your doctor who will be able to help you understand whether there is a risk. From the first day I reduced the dose I started having brain zaps. What type of withdrawal symptoms might I get? The type of withdrawal symptoms you might get varies depending on the medication you're taking, and the type of drug it is. Find out about your medication for some starting points, and see our pages on different types of medication for more details: antidepressants. antipsychotics. lithium and other mood stabilisers. sleeping pills and minor tranquillisers. One of my main symptoms of anxiety is derealisation, and I also experienced this when starting and coming off medication, which isn’t often talked about. Am I having withdrawal symptoms or a relapse of my original illness? It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you're experiencing withdrawal symptoms or if your mental health problem is returning or getting worse. While it's different for different people, withdrawal symptoms often happen soon after you start to come off your medication and are sometimes different to symptoms or difficulties you've had before. What could help with withdrawal symptoms? Coping with withdrawal symptoms can be difficult, but there are things you can do that might help. You could: Talk to your doctor. They may be able to adjust your dose, or prescribe other medications to help with withdrawal symptoms you're experiencing. You can ask your GP about this regardless of whether it was your GP or a psychiatrist who prescribed the medication you’re reducing. Ask if you can switch medication. You could also ask your doctor about changing to a different drug that is easier to taper down from. For example if you're taking a drug with a short half-life, it could help to switch to another drug with a longer half-life, as this can reduce withdrawal symptoms. Reduce your dose more slowly. It can be really discouraging if you get withdrawal symptoms, but this doesn’t mean you won’t be able to come off. It can sometimes help to take things more slowly than originally planned, or to stay at the same dose for longer before going down to a lower dose. For more suggestions on looking after yourself and getting support, including if you're experiencing withdrawal symptoms, see our pages on self-care during withdrawal and support services during withdrawal . You can report any withdrawal symptoms you experience to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card scheme .

"How can I look after myself as I come off? Coping while coming off medication can be hard, but there are lots of things you can do that might help. This page suggests some things you could try while coming off: Talk to someone. Keep a mood diary. Make a self-care box. Try other treatments. Be open to changing your plans. Look after your emotional wellbeing. Look after your physical health. For more tips that you could put in place before coming off your medication, see our page on planning for withdrawal .

For example, you can talk to Samaritans for free on 116 123 or [email protected] . For more options see our page on helplines and listening services . Keep a mood diary. Recording details of your medication and mood in a diary could help you remember helpful details. For example, when you started tapering your medication, what doses you've taken and when, and the effect of different doses on your mood. This may help you notice any patterns or early signs that things are becoming more difficult for you. You could also try monitoring your mood using an online tool. Our useful contacts page has links to find mood diaries online. Make a self-care box. Many people find that when they are feeling unwell their thinking can get confused and they struggle to make decisions or come up with ideas for what can help them feel better. For this reason it can be really helpful to put together a box of things when you are feeling ok that might help you when you are in a difficult patch. For example, you could include: favourite books, films or music. a stress ball or fiddle toy. helpful sayings or notes of encouragement. pictures or photos you find comforting. a soft blanket or cosy slippers. a nice-smelling candle or lavender bag. anything that is comforting to you or helps you to distract yourself. Try other treatments. Other types of treatment could help you cope during withdrawal. For example, you may want to try talking therapy and counselling, arts or creative therapies, or complementary and alternative therapies.  Be open to changing your plans. Coming off medication isn't something you can 'succeed' or 'fail' at, it's more about what is best for you at a particular moment in your life. For example, you might find you need to reduce more slowly, or stay at one dose for longer than you had planned. Try to remember that coming off medication can be a very slow process involving a number of steps and adjustments. If withdrawing from medication isn't going as well as you'd hoped, this can feel really disappointing. But this doesn't mean you won't be able to come off in the future if this is still what you want. It's also important to remember that you can change your mind about coming off. You don't have to keep withdrawing after you've started. Look after your emotional wellbeing. Look after your stress levels. It can help to think of ways to manage pressure and build your emotional resilience.  Try relaxation techniques. Learning to relax can help you look after your wellbeing when you are feeling stressed, anxious or busy.  Spend time in nature. Being outside in green space can help you feel more in touch with your surroundings.  Look after your physical health. Prioritise sleep. Sleep can give you the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences so prioritising getting enough sleep can make a big difference to your health.  Eat regular healthy meals. Eating regularly and choosing foods that release energy slowly keeps your blood sugar stable, which can make a big difference to your mood and energy levels.  Do some physical activity. Exercise can be really helpful for your mental wellbeing.  Avoid drugs and alcohol. It's especially important that you don't try to use recreational drugs or alcohol to replace your medication. While they may numb difficult feelings temporarily, they will make you feel a lot worse in the long term and prevent you being able to come off your medication safely. "

"How can friends and family help? This section is for friends and family of someone who is coming off, or thinking about coming off, a psychiatric medication. You may feel nervous or worried if someone you care about is thinking of coming off their medication. It may feel difficult to know how to talk to them about it, or what support to offer. There are a few helpful things you can do though: Try to understand. Ask how you and others can help. Help them get support. Try to be patient. Look after yourself. Try to understand. Ask them about their experience of taking medication. You could ask how it affects them and why they are thinking of coming off it. Listening to their experience might help you to understand how they feel. Respect their wishes. It can be really difficult if you don't agree about what's best. If you don't agree it may be helpful to explain why, but it's important to respect their wishes and not try to take over or make decisions for them. Ask how you and others can help. Ask what help they would find useful. This might include helping with everyday things like shopping or housework, taking them to appointments or reminding them to take a different dose of their medication. You could also help them make a support plan , which would help you to know how you can support them if they become unwell again. Help them get support. Supporting your friend or loved one to get the support they need can make a big difference. Read our information on planning for withdrawal and support services. Help them research different options for support, such as community services, local Minds or peer support groups. See our useful contacts for more information. Offer to go to appointments with them or to help them find an advocate, if they would find this helpful.  Try to be patient. Coming off medication can be a slow process that often involves a number of stages and adjustments. Some people will need more time than others, and some medications take longer to taper safely . While tapering is sometimes possible over a few weeks, it can take months or even years for some people to reach their medication goal, whether this be stopping completely or reducing to a particular dosage that feels better for them. How long it takes will depend on the individual, their circumstances and the medication they are taking. It's important to be patient. It could help if you: Try to be supportive if the process is sometimes difficult. For example if they're struggling with withdrawal effects or are unsure whether what they're experiencing is withdrawal effects or the return of their original mental health problem. Understand that it could take time. There might be a number of ups and downs before things get more stable. Don't jump to conclusions. Try not to assume they need to stay on medication if they're finding tapering difficult. I'm worried about their decision It can be very worrying if you're supporting someone who wants to come off medication and you disagree with their decision. It might help to talk to them about your worries, and to explore support options for yourself. You can find some suggestions below. Our page on helping someone else seek help has more information, including what you can do if someone doesn't want help . Look after yourself. It can be really challenging to support someone, and it's common to feel overwhelmed at times. It's important to remember to look after your own mental health too, so you have the energy, time and distance you need to be able to help your friend or family member. For example: Set boundaries and don't take too much on. If you become unwell yourself you won't be able to offer as much support. It is also important to decide what your limits are and how much you are able to help them.  Share your caring role with others if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone. Talk to others about how you’re feeling. You may want to be careful about how much information you share about the person you’re supporting, but talking about your own feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too. "

"This page covers: What is mindfulness? How does mindfulness work? Can mindfulness help treat mental health problems? Cymraeg - read this page in Welsh What is mindfulness? Mindfulness is a technique you can learn which involves noticing what's happening in the present moment, without judgement. You might take notice and be aware of your mind, body or surroundings. The technique has roots in Buddhism and meditation , but you don't have to be spiritual, or have any particular beliefs, to try it. Mindfulness aims to help you: become more self-aware. feel calmer and less stressed. feel more able to choose how to respond to your thoughts and feelings. cope with difficult or unhelpful thoughts. be kinder towards yourself. Many people find practising mindfulness helps them manage their day-to-day wellbeing, but it doesn't always work for everyone. For more information, see our page on whether mindfulness is right for you . Mindfulness is a skill. It requires work like any therapy, and requires practice like any skill. It isn't a shortcut and courses only set the scene, but I find it enjoyable and rewarding. Most of all I find it brings some peace into my life. How does mindfulness work? Mindfulness works by taking your focus to the present moment and away from other thoughts. The way we think, and what we think about, can affect how we feel and act. For example, if you think or worry a lot about upsetting past or future events, you might often feel sad or anxious. It is understandable to want to stop thinking about difficult things. But trying to get rid of upsetting thoughts can often make us think about them even more. The theory behind mindfulness is that by using various techniques to bring your attention to the present, you can: Notice how thoughts come and go in your mind. You may learn that they don't have to define who you are, or your experience of the world, and that you can let go of them. Notice what your body is telling you. For example, you might feel tension or anxiety in your body, such as a fast heartbeat, tense muscles or shallow breathing. Create space between you and your thoughts. With this space, you can reflect on the situation and react more calmly. For more information on how mindfulness works, see the Oxford Mindfulness Centre website . This organisation also provides free online mindfulness sessions . When I feel anxiety building, mindfulness helps me to keep calm by becoming more in touch with the situation. Can mindfulness help treat mental health problems? Studies show that practising mindfulness can help to manage common mental health problems like depression , anxiety and feelings of stress . There is some evidence that mindfulness could help with more complex mental health conditions, such as psychosis and bipolar disorder . But more research is needed in this area. You might find mindfulness very helpful. Or you might feel like it doesn't work or makes you feel worse. It's important to do what works for you and your mental health. You can also talk to your doctor about what kinds of treatments might suit you best. You might find trying mindfulness is useful while waiting to receive other types of treatment. For more information, see our page on deciding if mindfulness is right for you . In some cases, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends some structured mindfulness-based therapies which have been developed to treat mental health problems. However, NICE does not recommend using mindfulness-based treatments for social anxiety . This is because there's not enough evidence that it's effective. Mindfulness does help me with my mental health issues. It's not the cure and it won't work every single time, but it has helped me to alleviate anxiety and depression by centring my thoughts.

"This page covers: Mindfulness exercises you can try. How to get the most from mindfulness. Cymraeg - read this page in Welsh Mindfulness exercises you can try. If you want to try mindfulness, you don't need any special equipment for the following exercises: Mindful eating. This involves paying attention to the taste, sight and textures of what you eat. Try this when drinking a cup of tea or coffee for example. You could focus on the temperature, how the liquid feels on your tongue, how sweet it tastes or watch the steam that it gives off. Mindful moving, walking or running. While exercising, try focusing on the feeling of your body moving. If you go for a mindful walk, you might notice the breeze against your skin, the feeling of your feet or hands against different textures on the ground or nearby surfaces, and the different smells around you. Body scan. This is where you move your attention slowly through different parts of your body. Start from the top of your head and move all the way down to the end of your toes. You could focus on feelings of warmth, tension, tingling or relaxation of different parts of your body. Mindful colouring and drawing. Rather than trying to draw something in particular, focus on the colours and the sensation of your pencil against the paper. You could use a mindfulness colouring book or download mindfulness colouring images. Mindful meditation. This involves sitting quietly to focus on your breathing, thoughts, sensations in your body or things you can sense around you. Try to bring your attention back to the present if your mind starts to wander. Many people also find that yoga helps them to concentrate on their breathing and focus on the present moment. For more information on meditation and yoga, see our page on types of complementary and alternative therapies. The above examples are not the only ways you can practise mindfulness. So many activities can be done mindfully. Different things work for different people, so if you don’t find one exercise useful, try another. You can also try adapting them to suit you and make them easier to fit in with your daily life, such as mindfully cooking dinner or folding laundry. Some people find practising mindfulness in nature can have extra benefits – for suggestions, see our page on ideas to try in nature . For more general examples of exercises to try, see our page on relaxation exercises . The mindfulness colouring really helps me unwind and relax in the evening. It promotes better sleep and I go to bed feeling ready to rest rather than anxious and wired. Tips on getting the most from mindfulness. To get the most out of mindfulness exercises, try your best to: Pay attention. Focus on things you can see, hear, smell, taste or touch. For example, when you take a shower, make a special effort to really pay attention to how the water feels on your skin. Take notice. When your mind wanders, which is just what minds do, simply notice where your thoughts have drifted to. Some people find it helpful to name and acknowledge the feelings and thoughts that come up. For example, you could think to yourself 'this is a feeling of anger', or 'here is the thought that I'm not good enough'. Be aware and accepting. Notice and be aware of the emotions you are feeling or sensations in your body. You don't need to try and get rid of any feelings or thoughts. Try to observe and accept these feelings with friendly curiosity, and without judgement. Choose to return. Choose to bring your attention back to the present moment. You could do this by focusing on your breathing or another sensation in your body. Or you could focus on your surroundings – what you can see, hear, smell, touch or taste. Be kind to yourself. Remember that mindfulness can be difficult and our minds will always wander. Try not to be critical of yourself. When you notice your mind wandering, you can just gently bring yourself back to the exercise. It sounded like a big undertaking but I was keen to get started. It felt like I might be about to discover something new about how my mind works. Practical tips for mindfulness. To get more out of mindfulness exercises, there are some practical things you can try to help improve your experience: Set aside regular time to practise. Regular, short periods of mindfulness can work better than occasional long ones. If you struggle to find the time, try choosing one or two things you already do daily, and do them mindfully. For example, you could practise mindfulness while doing the washing up or taking a shower. Make yourself comfortable. It can help to do mindfulness in a space where you feel safe, comfortable and won't be easily distracted. Some people also find that it helps to be outdoors or surrounded by nature. Take it slowly. Try to build up your practice bit by bit. You don't need to set ambitious goals or put pressure on yourself. Remember, you’re learning a new skill that will take time to develop. Don't worry about whether you're doing it right. Try not to worry about doing the exercises correctly. Focus on using them in the ways that are most helpful for you. Many people find it takes a while to feel comfortable doing mindfulness exercises. Mental health apps. There are various apps available that you could use to help yourself day-to-day. But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. Would you like some recommendations? We've put together a library of safe apps that meet our high quality standards. Mindfulness makes me feel safe because even when I can't access my counsellors, carers, medication and relapse prevention plan, mindfulness is still there. Nothing can take it away. Print this page"

You might find that these are organised through your place of work or education, or a local library or community centre. Some local Mind branches may run mindfulness courses and groups. For a fee, some private teachers may also offer introductory courses. I went on a mindfulness course once a week for about eight weeks.

Your doctor may be cautious about offering you benzodiazepines if you have: chest and lung problems. muscle weakness, such as myasthenia gravis. a history of alcohol or drug abuse. a diagnosis of personality disorder. Your doctor should prescribe a reduced dose of benzodiazepines if you have: liver or kidney problems. porphyria (a rare, inherited illness). Whether you are prescribed benzodiazepines may also depend on your age: Benzodiazepines are not suitable for children. This is except for rare cases of anxiety or insomnia caused by fear or sleepwalking, when diazepam may be prescribed. Older people should be given a lower dose than the standard adult dose. If you have any medical conditions or are receiving any other treatments, let your doctor know. This includes any conditions which aren’t listed here. They can help you decide whether or not it is safe for you to take this medication. Benzodiazepines during pregnancy and breastfeeding. There is not enough research to know exactly how common problems are with taking benzodiazepines while you are pregnant. Some people have reported the following problems with their baby after taking benzodiazepines during pregnancy: cleft palate. urinary tract abnormalities. heart abnormalities. stomach abnormalities. dyslexia (difficulty reading and writing). dyspraxia (problems with co-ordination and movement). autism. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some people have also reported the following problems in their baby after taking benzodiazepines towards the end of their pregnancy: drowsiness. floppy muscles. breathing problems. low body temperature. withdrawal symptoms including abnormal sleeping patterns, high-pitched crying, tremor (shaking), vomiting and diarrhoea. If you take certain benzodiazepines while breastfeeding, the medication may be present in your breast milk. In some cases, this can build up in your baby’s body and cause side effects. If you are breastfeeding, pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you can ask your doctor about the risks of taking your specific medication. Taking benzodiazepines with other medication. Combining benzodiazepines with other medications can change the effects of the drugs. This may include reducing the positive effects of either drugs. Or it may lead to negative side effects. Sometimes doctors may prescribe you benzodiazepines at the same time as other drugs. For example, they may prescribe benzodiazepines with antidepressants or antipsychotics . The benzodiazepines may be to help you cope with anxiety while you wait for the other medication to begin working. But there may also be negative effects from this, if the drugs interact in a way that causes unwanted side effects. You can find out about known medication interactions for individual benzodiazepines from the British National Formulary (BNF) A-Z list of drug interactions . You can also speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you are concerned about taking any other medication with benzodiazepines. This includes prescribed medication, over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies . Benzodiazepines with alcohol or recreational drugs Drinking alcohol can increase the sedative effect of benzodiazepines. This can cause some dangerous side effects. You can speak to your doctor or pharmacist about whether it’s safe to drink alcohol with a specific benzodiazepine. Some recreational drugs can also interact with benzodiazepines in a dangerous way.

"Side effects of benzodiazepines. This page lists many of the known side effects of benzodiazepines. The effects may be slightly different between individual drugs. And everyone reacts to medication differently, so you may or may not experience these effects. The most common side effects of benzodiazepines include: drowsiness. light-headedness. confusion. unsteadiness (especially in older people, who may fall and experience injuries). dizziness. slurred speech. muscle weakness. memory problems. constipation. nausea (feeling sick). dry mouth. blurred vision. Some less common side effects of benzodiazepines include: headaches. low blood pressure. increased saliva production. digestive disturbances. rashes. sight problems, such as double vision. tremors (shaking). changes in sexual desire. incontinence (loss of bladder control). difficulty urinating. Some rare side effects of benzodiazepines include: blood disorders. jaundice (yellow skin). gynecomastia (breast development in people assigned male at birth). Memory problems with benzodiazepines. For some people, benzodiazepines can cause problems with memory. These problems are likely to be with retaining new memories while you take the medication. It is unlikely that they will cause you to forget old memories. Your doctor may not prescribe benzodiazepines to help you sleep unless you are sure that you can sleep for a full night without being disturbed. This usually means sleeping for around seven to eight hours. This is because of how your mind works to retains memories while you are sleeping. Some benzodiazepines can disturb this process. Paradoxical effects of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines sometimes cause effects which are the opposite of the medication is meant to do. You may hear these referred to as 'paradoxical' effects. They include: aggressive behaviour. agitation. anxiety. delusions (strongly held beliefs that other people don't share). depersonalisation (feeling detached from your surroundings). depression. derealisation (feeling out of touch with reality). hallucinations. inappropriate behaviour, with loss of normal inhibitions. irritability. nightmares. personality changes. psychosis. rages. restlessness. suicidal thoughts or behaviour. These effects may happen with any benzodiazepine. They are more common in children and older people, and with short-acting benzodiazepines . Effects of long-term benzodiazepine use. If you take benzodiazepines for more than two to four weeks, you may experience symptoms like: difficulty concentrating. feeling dulled and slow. feeling isolated and unreal. feeling cut off from your emotions. feeling irritable and impatient. loss of confidence. weight problems. memory problems. You may also experience withdrawal symptoms while you are still taking the drugs. Or you may need to take a higher dose to continue feeling the positive effects of the medication. Reporting side effects of benzodiazepines. If you experience side effects from any medication, you can report them to the Yellow Card scheme , which is run by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) . This is the organisation which regulates the use of medications in the UK. You can report any side effect you experience, including any that are may already be known. You can also ask a healthcare professional to report any side effects for you. Recently I had a tough time and would love to go back on diazepam to help me through it, but personally wouldn't trust myself on it as I have a three-year-old son and I'm a single parent. I'm not sure I'd wake in the night or be able to function in the day."
"Withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines. This page covers: Can benzodiazepines cause withdrawal problems? What are the withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines? When might I experience withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines? How can I safely stop taking benzodiazepines? Antidepressants and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Can benzodiazepines cause withdrawal problems? You will not normally experience any withdrawal problems with benzodiazepines if you: take them occasionally, as a one-off dose. follow your doctor’s recommendations on how to take them. But if you take benzodiazepines regularly and for a long time, you may become dependent on them. This might mean you experience physical withdrawal symptoms if you stop or reduce your dose. Or you may feel that you cannot cope with your day-to-day life unless you take them. What are the withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines? If you experience withdrawal problems from benzodiazepines, you may have some of the following symptoms: abdominal cramps. agoraphobia (fear of situations which feel difficult to escape). anxiety, including physical symptoms such as muscle tension, tight chest, fast heartbeat, sweating, trembling or shaking. blurred vision. concentration problems. dizziness. face and neck pain. headaches. increased sensitivity to light, noise, touch and smell. loss of interest in sex. loss of appetite. mild to moderate depression. nausea (feeling sick). nightmares. panic attacks. restlessness. sleep problems. sore eyes. sore tongue and metallic taste. tinnitus (ringing in your ears). tingling in the hands and feet (pins and needles). unsteady legs. vomiting (being sick). weight loss. Some people may also experience more severe withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines. These may include: burning sensations in the skin. confusion. delusions (strongly held beliefs that other people don't share). depersonalisation (feeling detached from your surroundings). derealisation (feeling out of touch with reality). hallucinations. memory loss. muscle twitching. paranoia. seizures (fits). If you suddenly stop taking benzodiazepines, this can cause serious withdrawal symptoms. These include: confusion. psychosis. seizures. a collection of symptoms including a rapid heartbeat, sweating, high blood pressure, tremor (shaking), hallucinations and agitated behaviour. Eventually my doctor weaned me off it, very slowly, over months. Which was hard, but I knew it was the right thing to do. When might I experience withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines? Withdrawal symptoms can begin several hours after you stop taking a short-acting benzodiazepine. Or they can begin up to three weeks after you stop taking a long-acting benzodiazepine. This is because long-acting benzodiazepines can stay active in your system for a while after you have stopped taking them. The longer you take benzodiazepines, the more likely it is that you will find it difficult to stop and the greater your risk of withdrawal symptoms. Short-acting benzodiazepines can be especially difficult to come off if you have taken them for a long time.  How can I safely stop taking benzodiazepines? If possible, you should reduce your dose gradually when you stop taking benzodiazepines. This reduces the risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor can provide more specific advice on how to safely withdraw from your medication. You may also find it helpful to speak to others about your withdrawal. For example, this may be from a local or online support group, or help from friends and family.  Antidepressants and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Some people experience depression after coming off benzodiazepines. If you experience this, your doctor may offer you antidepressants to help you deal with the symptoms of depression. Although some research suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are not effective for treating depression that happens after coming off benzodiazepines.  You can also discuss any questions or concerns you have about this with your doctor."
"Comparing benzodiazepines. This page has information to help you compare different benzodiazepines. It has tables for comparing benzodiazepines mainly used for anxiety , and for comparing benzodiazepines mainly used for insomnia (difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep).

Different medications work for different people. Lorazepam suited me at the time I was in crisis, and diazepam suits me better in the longer term. How benzodiazepines differ from each other. There are several ways in which benzodiazepines are different from each other: Length of half-life Some benzodiazepines act on your brain and body for longer than others. The half-life of each drug is a helpful way to understand how long a drug’s effects may last. Short-acting benzodiazepines have a shorter half-life. This means that the drugs are processed and leave your body more quickly. Short-acting drugs have a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms. This is because your body has less time to adapt to working without the drug once you stop taking it. Long-acting benzodiazepines have a longer half-life. This means that the drugs are processed by your body more slowly and take longer to leave the body. You are more likely to experience a ‘hangover’ effect when taking these drugs. But you are less likely to have withdrawal problems. Generally, short-acting benzodiazepines are used as sleeping pills and long-acting benzodiazepines are used for anxiety. But this is not always the case. Some drugs for anxiety may help you sleep if you take them at night. And lower doses of sleeping pills may help you feel calm if you take them during the day. Potency (strength) Benzodiazepines can have different levels of potency. This is to do with the strength of the chemical reaction that each drug causes in your body. If you take a lower dose of a high-potency benzodiazepine, this may cause similar effects to a higher dose of a low-potency benzodiazepine. Metabolisation (breakdown in the body) Benzodiazepines are broken down by the body in different ways. This process is known as your body metabolising the drug. Some benzodiazepine drugs, such as diazepam, produce further benzodiazepine chemicals when they are metabolised. These additional chemicals stay in your body and make the overall effect of the drug last longer."
"Non-benzodiazepine sleeping pills. This page has information about non-benzodiazepine medications that you may be prescribed to help you sleep.  This page includes a table to help you compare non-benzodiazepine sleeping pills by different factors. There is also information explaining different types of non-benzodiazepine sleeping pill: The Z drugs. Antihistamines. Melatonin. Chloral hydrate and clomethiazole. Barbiturates. Although we use the term ‘sleeping pills’ to describe these drugs, some of them may also be available as a liquid, either to swallow or for injection. Comparing non-benzodiazepine sleeping pills. This table lists all of the non-benzodiazepine sleeping pills currently licensed for use in the UK. Some of these drugs have more than one name.

The Z drugs are non-benzodiazepine sleeping pills, used to treat severe insomnia (difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep). They are known as the Z drugs because their generic names begin with the letter ‘z'. The Z drugs currently licensed for prescription in the UK are zolpidem and zopiclone . The medication zaleplon used to be included in this group, but it is no longer licensed for use in the UK. These drugs are not benzodiazepines, but they act in a very similar way. This includes causing similar problems with dependence and withdrawal. They are short-acting drugs, which means their effects last for a short period. And they are less likely to have a ‘hangover’ effect than some other types of sleep medication. When might I be prescribed a Z drug? Your doctor should only prescribe you a Z drug if you are experiencing severe insomnia. And they should only do this after you have tried other, non-medication treatments. If your doctor prescribes you a Z drug, they should: give you the lowest dose that has an effect. prescribe them for the shortest time possible. prescribe them strictly according to the licence for that specific drug. If you are an older person, your doctor may offer you a Z drug ahead of other sleep medication. This is because any negative effects from these drugs are likely to last for less time than with other sleep medication. But you should still take them for the shortest time possible. Who should avoid taking Z drugs? Your doctor will not normally prescribe you Z drugs if you have: severe lung disease or breathing problems. sleep apnoea (breathing problems during sleep). severe liver or kidney disease. severe and uncontrolled myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular condition). Your doctor may be cautious about offering you Z drugs if you have: chest and lung problems. neuromuscular weakness, such as myasthenia gravis. a history of alcohol or drug abuse. a diagnosis of personality disorder. Your doctor should prescribe a reduced dose of these drugs if you have: liver or kidney problems. porphyria (a rare, inherited illness). There may be risks with taking these drugs if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. But there is not enough research to know exactly how common these problems may be. If you are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant, you can speak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking a Z drug. They can help you make the best decision for your situation. How should I take Z drugs? If you are taking Z drugs, you should: try not to take them with food or straight after eating, as this may make them work more slowly. avoid taking them with alcohol. not take a second dose in one night. take them when you are ready for sleep, and not before. After taking them, you may feel unsteady or clumsy if you need to get up in the night, such as to go to the toilet. You shouldn’t normally take sleeping pills for more than three weeks. Ideally, you would take them for no more than one week. How should I come off Z drugs? When you stop taking Z drugs, you should withdraw from them gradually to avoid negative withdrawal effects. And if you find that one Z drug doesn’t work for you, your doctor should not prescribe you another Z drug to try instead. Z drugs and dangerous activity during sleep All Z drugs can sometimes cause a type of sleep-walking, when you may get up and do things while you are not really awake. These include: dangerous activities like driving. eating, including inappropriate food (such as raw food that should be cooked). having sex. being violent to your bed partner. When you wake up you may not remember anything about what you have done. If you are taking a Z drug and you carry out dangerous activities while you sleep, you should tell your doctor about this immediately. In the past I have suffered manic and psychotic episodes. Being able to sleep was important in helping me recover, so the 'Z' drugs they gave me in hospital really helped. Antihistamines. Antihistamines are a type of medication mainly used for treating symptoms of allergies, such as hay fever. But some of them also have drowsiness as a side effect. These drugs can also be used to help with short-term insomnia. You can buy the following drugs without a prescription from a pharmacist, to help with insomnia: diphenhydramine. promethazine. These are long-acting medications, which means their effects last for a longer time. This also means they are more likely to leave a ‘hangover’ effect the day after you take them. They may also be slow to act, which means they may not make you feel sleepy straight away. And they may lose their effectiveness if you take them for a few days. If you take antihistamines but they are no longer helping you sleep, you can speak to your pharmacist for advice. Who should avoid taking antihistamines? Your doctor or pharmacist may advise you to be cautious about taking antihistamines if you have: an enlarged prostate gland. problems urinating (urinary retention). glaucoma (raised pressure in the eye). liver disease. epilepsy. porphyria (a rare, inherited illness). Your doctor or pharmacist may advise you to avoid taking antihistamines if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. But there may be certain cases when your doctor will recommend or prescribe this medication. If you are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to get pregnant, you can speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about taking antihistamines. They can give you the best advice for your situation. Side effects of antihistamines Common side effects of antihistamines include: disorientation (feeling confused about where you are). dizziness. headaches. nightmares. restlessness. tiredness. Occasional side effects of antihistamines include: blurred vision. confusion. dry mouth. excitement. urinary retention. These occasional side effects are more common in older people. Children may also be more likely to experience excitement as a side effect. Rare side effects of antihistamines include: blood cell disorders. disturbances of heart rhythm. loss of appetite. low blood pressure. muscle spasms. sensitivity to sunlight. shaking. stomach discomfort. tic-like movements. You can speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure whether antihistamines are suitable for you. This includes letting them know if you are taking any other medication, including herbal remedies . Melatonin. Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by your pineal gland. This is a gland in your brain which regulates your body’s response to the 24-hour cycle of day and night. Melatonin is also available as a medication to help with insomnia. It is usually offered as a short-term medication for people aged 55 and over. It is not generally recommended for anyone under the age of 18. But it may be offered to them in certain circumstances. Your doctor may also avoid prescribing you melatonin if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. You can speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you are concerned about this.  Chloral hydrate and clomethiazole. Chloral hydrate and clomethiazole are older drugs with many side effects, including possible dependence. Chloral hydrate is a liquid drug, but it may also be available in tablet form called cloral betaine. And clomethiazole may also be spelled chlomethiazole. These drugs are not usually offered nowadays as medication for insomnia. But they may be used in some rare circumstances. Your doctor may avoid prescribing you these medications if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. They may also be cautious about prescribing them if you have a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or a diagnosis of a personality disorder. If you are chloral hydrate, you should avoid it coming into contact with your skin as it may cause skin damage. Barbiturates. Barbiturates were used as sedatives before benzodiazepines became available. They are rarely prescribed nowadays. You should only be offered them to treat severe insomnia if: you are already taking barbiturates. other treatments have not helped your insomnia. Barbiturates should not be offered to older people."

"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Explains what vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is, how it works, what are the side effects, and what to think about before having the treatment. This page covers: What is VNS? How does VNS work? What are the side effects of VNS? How can I access VNS? What should I think about before getting VNS? What if VNS doesn't work? What is VNS? Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a type of surgery that can treat mental health problems. Rarely, doctors may use it to treat: Severe depression, if other treatments have not helped. Epilepsy. Some research shows that VNS can reduce the symptoms of severe depression that hasn't been helped by other treatments. This is sometimes called 'treatment-resistant' depression. Doctors are unlikely to suggest VNS unless you have tried at least two other types of treatment, and these treatments have not worked. This may include treatments like talking therapy or medication . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends using VNS for treatment-resistant depression. But their guidelines state that it should only happen with certain conditions, including the following: Your doctor should talk to you about the procedure, including any risks or side effects. This is so that you can give informed consent to have the treatment. After having the procedure, you should have regular check-ups with your doctor to see if the treatment is working or causing any problems. How does VNS work? The VNS procedure happens using anaesthetic. This will either be general anaesthetic, which sends you to sleep. Or local anaesthetic, where you are awake but a part of your body is made numb. Doctors will place a small electric device under the skin of your chest, just below your collar bone. This device is a bit like a pacemaker. They will attach this device with some wires to a nerve in the left side of your neck. This is called the vagus nerve, which naturally sends signals to your brain. The VNS device sends electrical pulses to your vagus nerve to stimulate this process. This stimulation will happen automatically for 30 seconds every 5 minutes. The VNS device will stay in until it runs out of battery. This can take 3 to 8 years. If you need to, you can have the device turned off or removed. VNS may help to improve your mood and reduce your symptoms of depression. Some people can feel a little better straight after surgery. Others may take 6 months or longer before noticing any improvements in their symptoms. But VNS it will not work for everyone. And there is limited evidence on the benefits of this treatment. What are the side effects of VNS? Possible side effects of VNS are: feeling hoarse or having other changes to your voice. coughing. headaches. neck pain. feeling prickles or tingles in your skin. sore throat. difficulty breathing. difficulty swallowing. There is also a small risk of infection or other complications from the surgery. Your doctor should talk to you about the risks and side effects before you give your consent to have VNS. If you experience side effects, your doctor may be able to reduce how intense or frequent the electrical pulses are. This might help to reduce any side effects that you experience. Side effects may also get better over time. If you ever have an MRI scan, you should always tell them about your VNS device. It may also be help to tell staff if you need to go through airport security. How can I access VNS? VNS is still a rare treatment in the UK. It can be difficult to access. You will need a psychiatrist to refer you to have the treatment. It is only available in specialist centres, and only in certain areas of the country. What should I think about before getting VNS? If your doctor recommends that you have VNS, these are some questions you could ask to learn more. Or you could ask someone you trust, or an advocate , to ask these questions for you: Why have you suggested VNS? What are its benefits? How likely is it that VNS will work for me? What are the risks and side effects? What does the operation involve? How long will I have to stay in hospital? What other treatment options are available to me? Have you offered me every other available treatment? What happens if VNS doesn’t work or something goes wrong? How long will it take me to recover from surgery? When will I feel the effects? What if VNS doesn't work? It might feel frustrating or disappointing if a treatment such as VNS doesn't work for you. Especially if you feel like you have tried lots of different things already. Try to not to blame yourself. And remember that different things work for different people. You could also talk to your doctor about other options you could try.  Print this page"

Your doctor is there to help you with your mental health as well as your physical health. They could: make a diagnosis. offer you support and treatments (such as talking therapies and medication). refer you to a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist. recommend local support options. To find out more see our pages on: talking to your GP. what might happen at the appointment. making sense of your options. being actively involved. making yourself heard. GP appointments during coronavirus Most GPs should offer face-to-face appointments during the coronavirus pandemic. If you prefer this to a telephone or online appointment, you can request this from your GP. But many of us may still struggle to get a face-to-face appointment with our GP. Or we may worry about visiting the surgery in person while the pandemic is ongoing. If you are struggling with this, the NHS has information on accessing NHS services online or over the phone , including GP appointments. The first time I went to my GP about my depression, I was completely terrified. I had suffered in silence for 6 months, and was so ashamed that I couldn't 'fix' it myself. A trained therapist Trained therapists and counsellors provide a range of different therapies through the NHS, for which your doctor could refer you (known as secondary care). In some cases you might be able to contact them directly. To find out more see our page on finding a therapist . Friends, family, carers and neighbours Sometimes it can help to talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling. They could: help you to find information. discuss your options with you. come with you to appointments. help out with everyday tasks. give encouragement and support. To find out more see our page on talking to friends and family . Charity and third sector organisations There are many national and local charities which offer various support services, such as: helplines and listening services. information and signposting. other services such as peer support, talking therapies, advocacy, crisis care, employment and housing support. To find out more see our page on third sector services . Peer support Peer support brings together people with similar experiences. Your peers can: support you and listen to how you're feeling. offer empathy and understanding. share experiences, information, suggestions for self-care and support options. To find out more see our pages on peer support . Student services Higher education institutions usually have a student wellbeing centre where enrolled students can go for support. To find out more see our pages on student mental health . Community support services If your mental health problems are severe or longer lasting, your doctor can put you in touch with specialist mental health services. These might include community mental health teams (CMHTs), social care services, residential care services, and crisis resolution and home treatment teams (CRHTs or 'crisis teams'). To find out more see our pages on: support services. community and social care rights. crisis and home resolution teams (CHRTs). Workplace support Some workplaces offer free access to support services such as talking therapies. This is called an Employee Assistance Programme. To find out more see our pages on workplace mental health . Mental health apps. There are various apps available that you could use to help yourself day-to-day. But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. Would you like some recommendations? We've put together a library of safe apps that meet our high quality standards. What if I'm finding it difficult to seek help? Seeking help isn't always easy, especially when you're not feeling well. It can take time and may not be straightforward. But it's important to remember that you're not alone , and that you deserve support . If you're finding it difficult to access these services, or you've already tried these options and aren't sure where to turn next, see our page on facing and overcoming barriers . And remember that a lot of what you do to look after yourself will be during your day-to-day life – not just healthcare appointments – so it's always worth thinking about what helps you feel better in general.

"How can I open up to friends and family? It can sometimes be really difficult to talk about your feelings with friends or family. It's common to feel worried about upsetting people you care about, and feel nervous about what people will think, or how it might affect your relationships. You may feel more comfortable opening up to friends or family than professionals, or you may find it easier to approach a professional (such as your doctor) first. There's no right or wrong way round. But the people closest to us can often be a valuable source of support. Whenever you feel ready, these tips might help you start the conversation: Find a method of communication that feels right for you. This might be a face-to-face conversation, or you might find it easier to talk on the phone or write down how you feel in a letter. Find a suitable time and place. There may not be a 'good' time, but it can help if you're somewhere quiet and comfortable, and are unlikely to be disturbed for a while. Practice what you want to say. You could do this in your head or make some notes. Phrases such as ""I've not been feeling like myself lately"" or ""I'm finding it hard to cope at the moment"" might provide a starting point. Offer them relevant information and examples. If you've found a useful description in a book or online, or seen someone on television or in a film saying something that feels right to you, you could use this to help explain what you're experiencing. Be honest and open. It can sometimes feel uncomfortable sharing something so personal, but explaining how your feelings are affecting your life may help others to understand. Suggest things they could do to help. This might just be listening and offering emotional support – or there may be practical help you need (see examples in our page on helping someone else seek help). Don't expect too much from one conversation. Understanding mental health problems can take time, and some people may be shocked or react badly at first. It's important to give them some time to process what you've told them. But if possible, plan to come back to the conversation with them again, to give you more opportunities to explain what you're going through. For more information about talking to your friends about your mental health, visit the Mental Health Foundation website ."
"What should I say to my GP? It's not always easy to start a conversation about your personal feelings with your GP – someone you may hardly know. And it can be especially hard when you're not feeling well. But it's usually the first step towards working out what kind of treatment and support might help you. Here are some things to consider: Be honest and open. Focus on how you feel, rather than what diagnosis you might meet. Try to explain how you've been feeling over the past few months or weeks, and anything that has changed. Use words and descriptions that feel natural to you – you don't have to say specific things to get help. Try not to worry that your problem is too small or unimportant – everyone deserves help and your doctor is there to support you. Being as open and honest as possible, even though extremely difficult, is what has assisted me. How can I prepare for an appointment? GP appointments are usually very short, and if you're feeling nervous you might forget to say things you think are important. Being prepared can help you get the most out of your appointment. Here are some suggestions: Write down what you want to say in advance, and take your notes in with you. Give yourself enough time to get to your appointment, so that you don't feel rushed or stressed. If you're feeling nervous, let your doctor know. Think about taking someone with you to support you, like a close friend or family member. If you've talked to your family or friends about how you feel, practise what you might say to your GP with them. Highlight or print out any information you've found that helps you explain how you're feeling. Think about the outcome that you want from your appointment (such as access to therapy). If you have a few things to talk about, you can ask for a longer appointment (you'll need to do this when you're booking it in). We've produced a brief leaflet to help you talk to your GP about your mental health. You can download it for free in English or Welsh from our Find the Words page here . We believe that everyone deserves the right mental health support from their GP practice. To find out more about Mind's work in this area, see our Find the Words campaign . How do I find and register with a GP? Everyone in England and Wales has the right to register with a GP and use their services. You don't need to provide a fixed address or show ID. If you live in England you can use the NHS online 'service search' tool for finding GP surgeries near you. If you live in Wales, you can find your nearest surgery by visiting the NHS 111 Wales website and searching for your postcode. When registering with a GP surgery, you might like to think about: how close it is to your home or work. if its opening times are convenient for you. whether the doctors have any specialist training in mental health. looking for patient reviews on the surgery's website. NHS Choices has a detailed guide on registering with a GP , including information on how to register if you are: homeless or away from home. visiting or living in the UK temporarily. a former armed forces member."
"What might happen when I talk to my doctor? On this page: What happens at the appointment? What might the outcome of my appointment be? Will everything I tell my doctor be confidential? What's in my medical records, and who can see them? What if I don't want a diagnosis? What happens at the appointment? In your appointment your doctor will probably make an initial assessment by asking questions about: your mood, thoughts and behaviours – sometimes by using questionnaires or forms which measure depression and anxiety. your lifestyle and any recent events in your life that might be affecting your wellbeing. any sleep problems or changes in appetite. your medical history, and your family's medical history. They might also check your physical health to rule out any physical illness. This could involve: taking your blood pressure. measuring your weight. doing some blood tests. What might the outcome of my appointment be? The outcome of your appointment will usually depend on: what you say. what your doctor thinks might help. what kind of support you would like. For example, your doctor might suggest one or more of the following options: Monitoring – your doctor might ask you to come back for another appointment before offering any treatment. Diagnosis – your doctor might give you a diagnosis, for example of depression or anxiety. This doesn't always happen after your first appointment and may only be possible after monitoring you over time or referring you to a specialist. Lifestyle changes – your doctor may suggest that making small changes to your exercise, eating and sleep habits may help you to manage your symptoms. Referral – your doctor could refer you to another service, such as talking therapies (sometimes called psychological wellbeing services). Self-referral – your doctor could give you details of a service you can contact yourself, for example psychological wellbeing services or a community mental health team (CMHT). Medication – your doctor might offer to prescribe you psychiatric medication. If they do this they should should clearly explain what it's for and explain any possible risks and benefits, so you can make an informed choice about whether or not you want to take it. If you drive , you might have to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVLA) if you're diagnosed with a mental health problem. (For more information on your right to drive, including when and how to contact the DVLA, see our legal pages on fitness to drive .) Will everything I tell my doctor be confidential? In most cases: yes . Your doctor should keep whatever you tell them confidential, and ask your permission before sharing it with anyone else. However, they may need to make an exception if they believe that you're at risk of seriously harming yourself, or someone else. In this case they should still try to tell you first so you know what's going on. Depending on how big they think the risk is, they could: Not tell anyone, but ask to see you again soon to check how you are, and keep seeing you regularly. Not tell anyone themselves, but ask you to tell other people yourself. For example, they could ask you to volunteer to go to hospital as an inpatient (called being a voluntary patient). Tell another health or social care professional, such as a psychiatrist or social worker, and ask for an assessment to see if you can be made to go to hospital under a section of the Mental Health Act (often called being sectioned). The decision to section someone is very serious and can only be taken jointly by a team of approved mental health professionals (AMHPs). (See our legal pages on sectioning for more information about when it may be legal to section you, and what your rights are.). Tell the police – but this would only happen if they believe there is a very immediate, serious risk of danger. If you care for children and are worried about what might happen if you tell your doctor how you're feeling, our pages on parenting with a mental health problem provide more information. What if I'm under 18? Some rules can be different when you're under 18 - but your rights matter too. We have separate guides for young people aged 11-18 to help you understand things like confidentiality, advocacy, and your rights if you have to go into hospital. What's in my medical records, and who can see them? Whenever you use an NHS service in England, a record is created for you. These records contain details about the care you've received. One of these is called your Summary Care Record (SCR), which lists key medical information about you, such as allergies, medication and bad reactions. You can also ask your doctor to add extra details into your SCR, such as your crisis care plan (if you have one). Certain healthcare professionals can then access your SCR electronically in different places, such as in your doctor's office and in hospital (with your permission). This can help them provide better care – especially in an emergency. There are data protection laws in the UK to ensure your health records are kept confidential and secure. You also have a legal right to access personal information held about you by an organisation, including GPs and hospitals. To find out more, see: Our legal pages on accessing your personal information (explains your rights regarding your personal information, and how to access your medical records). NHS information on your health and care records. NHS information on 'Can I access someone else's medical records?'. What if I don't want a diagnosis? Receiving a diagnosis can be a positive experience. You might feel relieved that you can put a name to what you're experiencing, and it can help you and your doctor discuss what kind of treatment might work best for you. However, not everyone feels this way. You might have complicated feelings about what a diagnosis would mean for you – or you might come to disagree with it entirely. It's important to remember that a diagnosis doesn't have to shape your entire life, and may come to be a relatively minor part of your identity. (See our introduction to mental health problems for more information on diagnosis, stigma around mental health problems, and recovery.)"
"How can I make sense of my options? Your doctor is supposed to help you give informed consent to any treatment they offer before treating you. This means that: You understand what you're agreeing to (or saying no to), including the benefits, the risks, and what other options you have. You're agreeing (or refusing) freely and willingly, meaning you don't feel pressured or rushed into something by other people (including doctors and family members). You're mentally capable of making your own decision, which is legally called 'having capacity'. (For information what this means see our legal page on capacity). Your doctor should help you by: Explaining the pros and cons of different options in a clear and balanced way. Providing written information for you to read (in print or online). Giving you enough time to make a decision you're happy with. Giving you the opportunity to actively say 'yes' or 'no'. Answering any questions you ask honestly, and showing respect for your decisions. What can I do if I don't understand my doctor? Unfortunately, not all doctors find it easy to make themselves clear at first. If you're still confused about your options after talking to your doctor, you can: Tell them so. They might not realise you don't understand. Keep asking them to give you more information, and explain what it means. Ask for information in a different format. (If you have a learning disability, ask for Easy Read format). Ask another healthcare professional to explain. (Pharmacists can help if you're confused about medication.). Discuss your thoughts with friends and family. You may find that just talking to someone outside of your healthcare team helps you work out what your questions and concerns are. If English isn't your first language, you can: ask for a translation of any written information ask your doctor to provide an interpreter for your appointment ask someone who can interpret to come with you to your appointment. Speak to someone with similar experiences (sometimes called peer support). Contact an advocate (see our pages on advocacy). Contact Mind's Infoline for information and support. The kinds of treatment and support you want to try may change over time, and it's common to feel unsure. Remember: it's OK to change your mind. What questions could I ask my doctor? You might want to ask: Why have they have chosen one form of treatment over another? How do they think it will help you? What are the possible side effects or disadvantages of the treatment you've been offered? How likely are they to happen? Are there any other options to choose from? (Your doctor may not always be able to offer exactly what you'd like, but they should always explain the reasons.). You might want to prepare some questions before your appointment, but you can ask questions before, during and after treatment. () Could I ever be given a treatment I haven't agreed to? Usually no. But there are some very specific circumstances in which you might not have a choice about your treatment. These include: If you're in hospital under a section of the Mental Health Act (often called being sectioned). In this case your doctor should give you information and listen to your opinion, but they might legally be able to treat you against your wishes. (See our legal pages on sectioning for more information.). If you're under a community treatment order (CTO) – you may be given a CTO when you leave hospital after being sectioned. (See our legal pages on CTOs for more information.)If you 'lack mental capacity' – this is a legal term meaning you aren't currently considered able to understand information or make decisions (see our legal page on capacity for more information.). See our legal pages on agreeing to treatment for more information about your legal rights to agree or refuse a treatment."
"How can I get actively involved in my care? Making decisions about your treatment should be a conversation, involving both you and your healthcare professionals. This is sometimes called shared decision making . Remember that it takes two kinds of expertise to find the right treatment for you: Professional expertise on: medical knowledge different diagnoses what might be effective treatment. Your own expertise on: your experiences how you feel what you want. Can I choose my GP practice, doctor or nurse? Having a good relationship with your GP can be a really important way of getting the right support. If you're not making progress with your current GP, you can: Ask the receptionist to make you an appointment with a different doctor. They don't have to say yes, but if they say no then they should give you a reasonable explanation (for example, if your GP surgery is very small or other doctors aren't available on the days you need). Ask to talk to a different type of practitioner, like a nurse, specialist mental health worker or practice counsellor. Ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health specialist. Move to a different GP surgery if there is one in your local area, although you will have to register with them and this could delay seeing someone. Self-refer to another service without your GP (in some cases). If you live in England you can search for NHS talking therapies services on the NHS website to find out if there's a self-referral service near you. You may also be able to access therapy without a referral through third sector services. () My practice nurse was great as a go-between with the GP, who then knew how to handle my appointments and where to suggest we go to for help. Can I choose my treatment? When deciding what treatment to offer you, your doctor is likely to follow the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines . These set out recommendations for different kinds of conditions based on evidence for what helps. The most common treatments recommended for mental health problems are talking therapies and psychiatric medication . But treatments work differently from person to person, and it's not always possible to predict what will suit you best. You might have to try different things to find out what works for you. So it's important to keep talking to your doctor about how you're feeling, and letting them know what you want. () I was involved in choices about my medication. We agreed on a particular antipsychotic because of my issues around weight... and the change happened because of me! That made me feel in charge of my own care. Can I choose a time and place that suits me? Whatever treatment you're offered, your healthcare provider should aim to deliver it within a reasonable amount of time and in a reasonable location. You can: choose the service closest to where you live, or refuse a service if it's too far away. ask for home visits (if you find it hard to leave your home). ask for an estimate of how long the waiting lists are for suitable therapies (you might decide on a particular treatment because it is available more quickly). If you're offered medication you can: discuss when you will start, how long you will take it and when you will come off it. ask for a medication review at any time. ask your doctor for other support while you are waiting (if you need to see a specialist first). However, there are likely to be limits to when and where you receive treatment . Some services only exist in certain areas. And unfortunately, there can be long waiting times to access talking therapies through the NHS. ()"
"How do I make sure people listen to me? Seeking help for a mental health problem can feel complicated, and you might sometimes feel like healthcare professionals aren't listening to how you feel. This page covers the following ideas to help you feel more in control and empowered: do your own research. understand the guidelines and policies. find an advocate. I feel, as a patient, I am the expert on me. So I know more than anyone else what is going on in my head, and I know what I need. Do your own research. Although your doctor should give you the information you need to make informed decisions, you can also do your own research. This might help you find other options that you can suggest or ask about. For example, you can: Look for information that is trustworthy and reliable, such on the NHS UK website or information from organisations mentioned on our useful contacts page. Speak to other people with similar experiences and ask what they found helpful. You may want to do this through an online forum, such as Side by Side or HealthTalk, or by finding a peer support group (See our information on finding peer support or ring the Mind Infoline which can help you work out what's available in your area). Search online for blogs or videos from people who've had similar experiences. If you'd like some help doing this safely, see our pages on staying safe online. In the past six years I have had counselling, a brief attempt at CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and routine meetings with mental health doctors, but the thing I have found most helpful is open online forums full of people like me. Understand the guidelines and policies. Most aspects of healthcare are covered by clinical guidelines and policies, which outline: which treatments are most likely to work for you. how your healthcare professionals should interact with you in general. the quality of service they should provide. Examples of these documents include: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, which outline evidence-based treatment options for different conditions. (Find out more on the NICE website.). Confidentiality and data protection policies, which outline your rights regarding any personal information your doctor holds about you, and what they must do to keep it private. Codes of practice for people who are members of professional bodies, for example doctors, nurses and accredited counsellors. Complaints procedures. These should be accessible and easy to find using a web search, but you can also ask your doctor or healthcare provider to show them to you. Find an advocate. An advocate is an independent person who is there to represent your opinion and help make your voice heard. This can be extremely helpful if you are finding it hard to let healthcare professionals know what you want, or you're facing barriers to getting support . An advocate can: come with you to appointments. help you ask questions and assert your wishes. support you if you want to make a complaint or appeal any decisions. A friend, family member or carer might be willing to act as your advocate informally. Or you could consider professional advocacy services. () My parents and sister were my speakers for me. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them and their strength and fighting attitude to get me help."
"What barriers might I face? Seeking help for a mental health problem can be difficult, and you might sometimes face barriers to getting the treatment you need and deserve. This page covers: What if my doctor won't offer me the treatment I want? What if the treatment I need isn't available? What if I've tried everything and nothing works? What if I'm unhappy with how professionals are treating me? What if my doctor won't offer me the treatment I want? Sometimes your doctor might not offer you a particular treatment, even when it is available. Possible reasons for this might be: They think it's unlikely to help you. They think it could be harmful to you – for example, if you have had previous problems with addiction your doctor might choose not to offer you potentially addictive medication, such as certain tranquillisers. They've overlooked it – sometimes doctors aren't aware of all local services, or don't remember to let you know that you can use them. If your doctor won't offer you a particular treatment you can always ask them for an explanation, and ask if there is an alternative that they can suggest. Can I ask for a second opinion? You can ask for a second opinion from another GP or psychiatrist and, where possible, your doctor should allow this. They will normally need to make the referral and explain your reasons. However, you do not have a legal right to a second opinion, so your doctor could refuse. It's harder to get a second opinion from a psychiatrist than a GP because there are fewer of them practising. I've found that [my] care has varied widely, and the primary issue I have encountered absolutely everywhere is the lack of signposting to the care options available. What if the treatment I need isn't available? Unfortunately, not all treatments are equally available across the country. And even in places where the service you need exists, there can often be very long waiting times to access treatment through the NHS. You can ask your doctor for a different kind of treatment, but this won't always be possible because of cost or availability. We understand how frustrating and upsetting this can be. You might be able to find an alternative option to explore in our page on where to start , and our section on what if I've tried everything? might offer more ideas you could try. It's not an option for everyone, but some people consider treatment through the private sector . Campaigning for change Mind is campaigning to make sure that everyone has access to crisis care and talking treatments when they need them. Find out more about what we're doing , and see how you can campaign with us . What if I've tried everything and nothing works? If you've already explored all the options your doctor has offered, and you haven't found the help you're looking for yet, it can feel like you've tried everything and nothing works. Unfortunately finding the help you need can sometimes be really difficult, and can take time. But it's important to remember that you're not alone, and that you deserve support. Keep trying – don't give up. If you've had bad experiences with the people and professionals you've spoken to so far, you could give them another chance – or try again with someone new. (). Develop your coping techniques. Planning positive ways look after yourself while you're on waiting lists can help you cope. (). Talk to people who understand. Getting support and encouragement from people who've been in a similar situation can be really valuable, even if they can't change what you're going through. (). Explore any alternatives. Our information pages on treatments and therapies could give you more options to discuss with your doctor. There may be something you haven't tried yet that could be helpful. Find an advocate. An advocate can help you express your views and wishes, and help you access the help and support you deserve (see our pages on advocacy for more information). Know your rights. Our legal pages explain your rights in a range of situations. If you're being treated unfairly by healthcare professionals, you can complain. Talk to Mind. We're here for you. Our Infoline can help you explore all your options for support near you, and we have local Mind branches throughout England and Wales who provide a range of services you may be able to access. Getting help can feel like a mammoth task at the beginning and it's very easy to feel disheartened if the outcome isn't what you'd hoped for. But there is always somewhere else you can get help and the majority of people working and volunteering in mental health do genuinely care about helping you get the support you need for your recovery. What if I'm unhappy with how professionals are treating me? Unfortunately, some people can have very negative experiences with the healthcare system. Our legal pages offer lots of information about your legal rights, and what you can do to make sure your rights are being respected. In some situations you might feel so unhappy with how you've been treated that you want to make a formal complaint about it. This might happen if you feel that: you've been treated unfairly by your doctor or another healthcare professional. your doctor or healthcare provider has made a mistake or failed to provide proper care (this is sometimes called clinical negligence). you haven't been offered a service you should have been. Racism in the mental health system. Everyone with a mental health problem deserves support and respect. But unfortunately we don't always get it when we need it. Institutional racism can be a factor in this. Our racism and mental health page has more information, plus suggestions for support. How do I make a complaint? You can make a complaint by: raising your concern directly with your healthcare professional (they should tell you about their complaints procedure if you ask for it). using the NHS complaints process, which you can read on the NHS Choices website. complaining directly to the General Medical Council (GMC) on the GMC website. (See our legal pages on complaining about health and social care for more information."
"How could the third sector help? Although the NHS is the largest provider of healthcare in the UK, there are often other support options to help you cope with a mental health problem. These include various community and third sector (charity) organisations such as: local Minds. counselling centres. community organisations. university counselling services (if you are a student). These kinds of services are normally free or low cost , and can offer a range of support, such as: talking therapies. peer support (support groups). advocacy. arts therapies. complementary and alternative therapies. advice services. online services, such as forums or live chat. However, they are not likely to: give you a diagnosis. provide medical services, such as psychiatry. prescribe medication. How do I find these kind of services? These kind of services aren't always easy to find, so it's worth asking around. Doing an internet search could be a good place to start. You could use a search engine, or try using the Hub of Hope website which has been set up by Chasing the Stigma (a mental health charity) to help you find local services near you. Your local library or community centre may know about groups running near you. Your GP or practice nurse might recommend local organisations you could contact. Mind's Infoline might also be able to help you find services in your area. If you are a student, your student services department can let you know if your university or college provides any free counselling services. You can often self-refer to these services, and you may also be referred by your GP."
"How can I seek help through the private sector? Although it's not an option for many people because of the financial cost, you might feel it's the right choice for you to see a private nurse, doctor, psychiatrist or therapist – either alongside NHS support, or instead of it. This page covers: Why might I decide to go private? How do I access private healthcare or therapy? How do I pay for private healthcare? Why might I decide to go private? Some common reasons for considering seeking help through the private sector might be: You're not receiving the support you want from your NHS GP. You want a second (or third) opinion, and your NHS GP isn't able to provide it. You want to access support more quickly, for example if there is a long waiting list for talking therapies on the NHS in your area. You're looking for a specialist treatment or more choice of treatments and providers. You want more intensive support, or support over a longer period of time. You want access to treatment that isn't available through the NHS. You want to attend a private hospital or clinic. Online healthcare services Some private companies may provide an online service where you can talk to a registered GP or therapist over video chat, or ask questions via a text messaging service. This is an option you could consider if you find it difficult to attend appointments in person. It may also be less expensive than other private healthcare options. How do I access private healthcare or therapy? Private GPs, nurses or clinics You can: ask your NHS GP to refer you or make a suggestion. search online for a private healthcare provider and contact them directly, or use an online listing service. Check their qualifications All doctors (including GPs and psychiatrists) and all nurses (including community psychiatric nurses (CPNs)) must be properly qualified and registered to be legally allowed to practice. You can check that they are registered by searching: Doctors – the General Medical Council's List of Registered Medical Practitioners. Nurses – the Nursing and Midwifery Council register. You can also ask them directly to show you their qualifications. I tried going through the NHS but counselling wasn't available out of work hours, which just wasn't viable for me. I did some research on local therapists in my area, sent a few emails regarding fees and availability, and picked the best fit for me. Private counsellors or therapists There are a number of different organisations who can help you find a therapist such as the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) . Any therapist you find through this website will have signed up to the BACP's ethical framework, which means they must: behave in a professional and safe way towards you. explain their responsibilities regarding confidentiality. tell you their complaints procedure if you ask for it. () How do I pay for private healthcare? Private healthcare can be expensive, so you may need to think carefully about how – or if – you will be able to afford it. Private therapy costs will usually depend on: what the therapist charges. how many sessions you go for. how often you go. Some private therapists offer a sliding scale of payment depending on your circumstances. There are two main payment options: Paying the healthcare provider directly. Your healthcare provider should explain any treatment or appointment costs clearly beforehand. Some providers may have payment plans that allow you to pay in instalments. Taking out private healthcare insurance. Insurance can cover part or all of the cost of your treatment, depending on your policy. Not all policies cover psychiatric treatment or pre-existing conditions, so before taking out any policy you should check it carefully and make sure you understand what it covers. ()."
"How can I help someone else seek help? Many people experiencing a mental health problem will speak to friends and family before they speak to a health professional, so the support you offer can be really valuable. This page covers: What emotional support can I offer? What practical support can I offer? What can I do if someone doesn't want my help? What if they believe things that seem very unusual or scary to me? What can I do if it's an emergency? How can I look after myself? If you regularly support someone with a mental health problem you might be considered a carer.  What emotional support can I offer? If someone lets you know that they are experiencing difficult thoughts and feelings, it's common to feel like you don't know what to do or say – but you don't need any special training to show someone you care about them. Often just being there for someone and doing small things can be really valuable. For example: Listen. Simply giving someone space to talk, and listening to how they're feeling, can be really helpful in itself. If they're finding it difficult, let them know that you're there when they are ready. Offer reassurance. Seeking help can feel lonely, and sometimes scary. You can reassure someone by letting them know that they are not alone, and that you will be there to help. Stay calm. Even though it might be upsetting to hear that someone you care about is distressed, try to stay calm. This will help your friend or family member feel calmer too, and show them that they can talk to you openly without upsetting you. Be patient. You might want to know more details about their thoughts and feelings, or want them to get help immediately. But it's important to let them set the pace for seeking support themselves. Try not to make assumptions. Your perspective might be useful to your friend or family member, but try not to assume that you already know what may have caused their feelings, or what will help. Keep social contact. Part of the emotional support you offer could be to keep things as normal as possible. This could include involving your friend or family member in social events, or chatting about other parts of your lives. I had one friend who helped me by just listening and never judging. Without him my recovery time would have been much longer. What practical support can I offer? There are lots of practical things you can do to support someone who is ready to seek help. For example: Look for information that might be helpful. When someone is seeking help they may feel worried about making the right choice, or feel that they have no control over their situation. Our page on making yourself heard will give you some ideas on what research you can do, and ways you can help someone think about what might work for them. Help to write down lists of questions that the person you're supporting wants to ask their doctor, or help to put points into an order that makes sense (for example, most important point first). Help to organise paperwork, for example making sure that your friend or family member has somewhere safe to keep their notes, prescriptions and records of appointments. Go to appointments with them, if they want you to – even just being there in the waiting room can help someone feel reassured. Ask them if there are any specific practical tasks you could help with, and work on those. For example, this could include: offering them a lift somewhere arranging childcare for them taking over a chore or household task. Learn more about the problem they experience, to help you think about other ways you could support them. Our website provides lots of information about different types of mental health problems, including pages on what friends and family can do to help in each case. What can I do if someone doesn't want my help? If you feel that someone you care about is clearly struggling but can't or won't reach out for help, and won't accept any help you offer, it's understandable to feel frustrated, distressed and powerless. But it's important to accept that they are an individual, and that there are always limits to what you can do to support another person. You can: Be patient. You won't always know the full story, and there may be reasons why they are finding it difficult to ask for help. Offer emotional support and reassurance. Let them know you care about them and you'll be there if they change their mind. Inform them how to seek help when they're ready (for example, you could show them our pages on talking to your GP and what might happen at the appointment). Look after yourself, and make sure you don't become unwell yourself. You can't: Force someone to talk to you. It can take time for someone to feel able to talk openly, and putting pressure on them to talk might make them feel less comfortable telling you about their experiences. Force someone to get help (if they're over 18, and it's not an emergency situation). As adults, we are all ultimately responsible for making our own decisions. This includes when – or if – we choose to seek help when we feel unwell. See a doctor for someone else. A doctor might give you general information about symptoms or diagnoses, but they won't be able to share any specific advice or details about someone else without their agreement. What if they believe things that seem very unusual or scary to me? If someone is experiencing reality in a very different way from people around them, they may not realise or agree that seeking help could be useful for them. They may be experiencing psychosis , mania , hearing voices or feeling very paranoid . In this case, it can also be helpful to: Focus on how their beliefs are making them feel (for example anxious, scared, threatened or confused), as these feelings will be very real. Avoid confirming or denying their beliefs. Instead it can help to say something like ""I understand that you see things that way, but it's not like that for me."". There are a lot of misunderstandings about what it means to experience psychosis. Lots of people wrongly think that the word 'psychotic' means 'dangerous'. But it's important to remember that in reality, very few people who experience psychosis ever hurt anyone else. () What can I do if it's an emergency? There may be times when your friend or family member needs to seek help more urgently, such as if they: have harmed themselves and need medical attention. are having suicidal feelings, and feel they may act on them. are putting themselves or someone else at immediate, serious risk of harm. If they are not safe by themselves right now Stay with them and help them call 999 for an ambulance, if you feel able to do so. Or you could help them get to A&E. They may appreciate it if you can wait with them until they can see a doctor. If they can keep themselves safe for a little while You can get quick medical advice by contacting NHS 111 in England, or NHS 111 Wales (in Wales, you can select option 2 for urgent mental health support). Or you could help them make an emergency GP appointment to see a doctor soon. You can also encourage them to call Samaritans on 116 123 to talk to someone, 24 hours a day. Or you could suggest they try another helpline or listening service . It may also help to remove things they could use to harm themselves, especially if they have mentioned specific things they might use. If you or others feel in danger right now You can call 999 and ask for the police to help. You might feel worried about getting someone in trouble, but it's important to put your own safety first. If you're not in a situation like this right now, but you're worried someone you care about may experience a mental health crisis in the future, it's a good idea to make a crisis plan with them to work out what steps you will take to help them in an emergency.  How does someone get sectioned? In exceptional circumstances it's possible to keep a person in hospital under a section of the Mental Health Act (often called being sectioned), and treat them without their agreement. The decision to section someone is very serious, and can only be taken by a team of approved mental health professionals (AMHPs). If you feel someone is at serious, immediate risk and will not approach anyone for help, you can contact their local social services, who can decide to arrange an assessment (you can usually find the number for social services on the local council's website). This is a heavy responsibility, so before taking action it's important that you understand what might happen, and what your loved one's rights are. It might also be a good idea to talk this through with someone you trust. (See our legal pages on sectioning and agreeing to treatment for more information). How can I look after myself? Supporting someone else can be challenging. Making sure that you look after your own wellbeing can mean that you have the energy, time and distance to help someone else. For example: Take a break when you need it. If you're feeling overwhelmed by supporting someone or it's taking up a lot of time or energy, taking some time for yourself can help you feel refreshed. Talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. You may want to be careful about how much information you share about the person you're supporting, but talking about your own feelings to a friend can help you feel supported too. Set boundaries and be realistic about what you can do. Your support is really valuable, but it's up to your friend or family member to seek support for themselves. Remember that small, simple things can help, and that just being there for them is probably helping a lot. Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone.

"Note: throughout this resource, we use the words 'they' and 'them' to refer to the person you are supporting. On this page we introduce what it means to be a carer, as well as: Caring and the benefits system. What you might do when caring for someone else. Caring for someone with a mental health problem. What is caring for someone else? Supporting someone else is sometimes called caring. You are a carer if you provide unpaid support and care for someone who has an illness, disability, mental health problem or addiction. Even if you spend a lot of time supporting someone else, you might not consider yourself as a carer. You might feel like you do not count as a carer because: you think it’s your responsibility to care for your relative or friend. you are providing support other than physical and practical support. you think the role of carer is defined by social services, and carers provided by them. Being someone's carer may only describe part of your relationship with them. You could be their parent, partner, sibling, child, grandchild, friend or other relative. This relationship can be just as, or more, important to you. You may also have other caring roles, for example taking care of your children. As I was adjusting to caring for my cousin, I was also caring for my elderly parents, both of whom had serious health problems. Caring can bring many positives and rewards. However, supporting others can be mentally and physically exhausting. The time you spend caring can vary too. Some people look after someone for a short time, others find themselves caring for someone in the long term. Caring and the benefits system. The benefits system in England and Wales can seem complex. However, understanding if you can access benefits could help you as a carer. The Carer's Allowance is a specific welfare benefit for carers, in addition to any benefits you usually claim. The benefits system defines you as a carer if you meet certain criteria, listed here on Carers UK . Even if you don't meet this criteria, you may have needs for additional support. And your local council authority may still consider you to be a carer. See our legal page on carers' social care rights for more information. Contact Mind's welfare benefits line if you need information or support about welfare benefits. Speak to a trained advisor on 0300 222 5782 (Mon to Fri, 9 am to 5 pm). What you might do when caring for someone else. Caring can mean a range of things. It may depend on whether you're caring for someone with a physical or mental health problem. It might also depend on whether it's a short-term or lifelong condition. Being patient and giving support can feel like part of the normal give and take of any relationship. But sometimes you might find that you spend a lot more time and effort helping someone else. You may provide a range of support such as: giving emotional support. helping someone cope with or seek help for a mental health problem. cooking and cleaning. providing personal care like washing and going to the toilet. budgeting and looking after finances. supporting them to live alongside other people in your household. helping others understand the needs of the person you are caring for. giving medicine or providing medical care. checking they are safe. going to appointments with them and advocating on their behalf – this means helping them express their views and wishes. Sometimes the person you care for may find it difficult to accept they need support from you. They may push you away or say things that upset you. This can make things feel extra hard. For more information, see our page on helping someone else seek help . Caring for someone with a mental health problem. If you look after someone with a mental health problem, you might be unsure whether what you do 'counts' as caring, or it's just part of day-to-day life. While some people think of caring as only physical tasks, giving emotional support is a big part of it. For more information, see our page on supporting someone with a mental health problem . I always thought a carer was someone who carried out the physical activities necessary. It hadn't occurred to me that while I helped him with the day-today things he found overwhelming, I also was mentally his carer too."
"Your mental health as a carer. It can help to understand common challenges that many unpaid carers encounter, as this might make you feel less alone. We explain some feelings you might experience while caring for someone, and how these can impact your mental health. On this page: Positive experiences of caring for someone. Difficult feelings and your mental health. Positive experiences of caring for someone. It can be a very positive and rewarding experience to know you are helping someone else. Some carers feel they've learnt more about their own strengths, or have helped others understand their condition, problem or disability. You might feel a sense of satisfaction from making a real difference to the life of the person you care for. Through your experience of supporting someone else, you may feel: more confident in dealing with other people. more understanding of others with problems. closer to friends and family. It isn't easy. There are times when it is desperate, exhausting and miserable. But overall I think we're stronger, more honest and more resilient as a couple. Difficult feelings and your mental health. Supporting someone else can affect your mental health and make it harder to stay well. Although you may truly want to care for them, you may also find it difficult and upsetting. If you're struggling with your own mental health and caring for a young person, see our information on parenting with a mental health problem . When caring for someone else, you might experience challenges and difficult feelings such as: Stress and worry. If you spend a lot of time thinking about their health and what will happen in the future, it may feel hard for you to switch off. Over a long time, worry and stress can cause mental health problems. It can also make existing problems worse. For more information, see our pages on stress. Anxiety. Many carers say that they feel a constant anxiety about the person they care for. If your feelings of anxiety are strong or last for a very long time, they can become overwhelming. They may impact your ability to live your life as fully as you want to. For more information, see our pages on anxiety. I got no support and I didn't really know that there was anywhere or anyone I could turn to. It had a huge impact on my mental health. I developed obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety and depression. Isolation and loneliness. You might have less time to socialise or pursue hobbies and interests. If you've given up work, you may not see the people you used to and you might not feel as close to the person you look after. It can feel hard to ask for help or to let people know you are a carer and why. Your life can sometimes feel very different and it can seem like others don't understand. Over time, you might start to feel lonely. Social isolation can lead to mental health problems like depression. For more information, see our pages on loneliness. Less time for yourself. You probably have less time to look after yourself, for example to be physically active, eat healthy food and relax. You may feel as though your health doesn't take priority, or you don't have time to get the help you need. For ideas you can try with limited free time, see our pages on relaxation techniques. The hardest thing for me is I can never forget I am a carer. Even if I get some 'me time', first I have to organise alternative care and if I can't get it, I have to cancel what I wanted to do. Money worries. You may have to pay for extra care, medical or travel costs. This can put a strain on your finances, especially if you're not getting enough financial support or benefits. You may have to cut down on work, or juggle work and caring, which can be difficult. For more information, see our pages on money and mental health. Lack of sleep. If you support someone who needs help at night – or you're very worried and stressed – you may not get as much sleep as you need. Not getting enough sleep can impact your mental health. For more information, see our pages on sleep and mental health. Guilt, frustration and anger. You may feel frustrated if you've given up parts of your own life, or feel you have no choice about the situation. You might end up directing this anger at family or the person you care for, which could make you feel guilty. For more information, see our pages on anger. The biggest thing for me is making time for myself, it is very easy to feel guilty about making time, and very difficult to do on a practical level. Low self-esteem. Looking after someone else can have a big impact on your self-esteem. You might feel that you should focus all your time on them. You might lose confidence in yourself and your abilities to do anything except supporting someone else. If you have given up work, you may feel that you have lost an important part of yourself. For more information, see our pages on self-esteem. Depression. You may find that the challenges you face when looking after someone else can make you feel low or depressed. You might develop unhelpful coping strategies to deal with difficult feelings. For example using drugs or alcohol, or eating more or less than you need to. If you feel very frustrated or hopeless, you may have thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life. For more information, see our pages on depression. If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency."
"Caring for someone with a mental health problem. You might be caring for someone with a physical health problem, a mental health problem, or both. For mental health problems, you may face slightly different or additional challenges. This page lists some of these, along with advice and suggestions that have helped other people. If you need practical information on organisations that can support you, see our page on support for carers . We have further information and support for people who care for a young person with mental health problems . You might have difficult thoughts like: You don't really see yourself as a carer. You don't think you help much. You don't understand what they are going through. You might have concerns, such as feeling: Worried you're doing the wrong thing. Worried about their safety. Worried about what other people think. You might experience challenges like: Your relationship is changing. They won't get help. They push you away or say upsetting things. It's hard to get them the help they need. Caring for someone with a mental health condition is hard. The invisibility of the illness can make it feel like you're not a 'real' carer. Trust me: you are. And you're making a huge difference to someone's life. You don't really see yourself as a carer. If you don't do many physical caring tasks, you may not really see yourself as a carer. But there are lots of other ways you might support someone. For example, you might: provide emotional support. help them to manage day-to-day tasks. support them in challenging times. advocate for them (see our pages about advocacy). encourage and support them to seek help. make phone calls for them. encourage them to feel confident in making decisions. be there for them during treatment. You may find that other people, such as family and friends, don't see you as a carer either. It may help to show them this information. Caring for my husband with bipolar I wanted to let others know that caring is lonely and exhausting but that help is there. Read Kate's story You don't think you help much. You may feel frustrated that you can't make someone feel better, or as if you're not 'enough' to make them happy. But like physical health conditions, mental health problems can affect anyone. No one can prevent someone else from having a mental health problem. You're probably helping a lot more than you think. If possible, try talking to them about how you help already. Try to build up a clear idea about what you can do. Accept parts that you can't do alone or things that you cannot change. Understanding what's possible and being aware of your limits might make you feel less helpless. You don't understand what they are going through. If you haven't experienced a mental health problem, it can be difficult to understand what it's like. Ask them to try and explain – but remember it isn't always easy to describe. You could both look at our mental health information , blogs and short videos . These resources might help them find something that puts it into the right words. Learning about a mental health problem and hearing from other people might be useful for you. It can help you understand what the person is experiencing and how you can help. How I came to understand my girlfriend's depression I had no idea that it could be a recurring illness – a lifetime struggle. Read George's story Worried you're doing the wrong thing. It's hard to know how much care to give or what to do for the best. You may worry that they're becoming too dependent on you. Or you might feel that things you do aren't helpful in the long term. Some people won't feel willing or able to tell you when their mood has changed and what they need. This can make it really hard for you. It's understandable if you sometimes get things wrong. Over time, you might be able to interpret their feelings and needs from their expressions and behaviour. They might not always be able to explain what would help in the moment. Some people find it helpful to set up little systems for communicating. For example you could talk about colours as different needs: Blue – I love you but I need to be alone. Amber – I can't talk but I do need company. Red – I'm feeling angry and irritable but it's not because of you. Black – I'm feeling vulnerable today. When someone is unwell, it can sometimes be easier to say 'I'm feeling amber' than to find the words. Different things work for different people – try to find something that suits you both. Our resources on mental health problems each contain a section for friends and family , which you might find useful. You might also find it helpful to seek out online mental health support . Online support comes from people who have mental health problems, or support others. You could join Mind's community Side by Side . Worried about their safety. You might feel worried that they may harm themselves or others. We have detailed information on helping someone who is self-harming and what you can do in an emergency . It can be very emotionally draining to be worried about the safety of someone you love. It's important to make sure you support yourself too. Our pages on self-care and support for carers list some ideas you can try. Worried about what other people think. You might be worried about how other people will treat them – or how they will treat you as a carer. Stigma and misunderstanding can be upsetting. Especially coming from friends or family, colleagues or healthcare professionals. It can make mental health problems feel difficult to talk about. But it's important to remember you are not alone. If you're worried about what others think, you could try the following: Talk about your experience by sharing your story. This can help improve people's understanding and change their attitudes. Find out more about writing a blog for Mind. Take action by campaigning with Mind. For details of different ways you can get involved with helping us challenge stigma, see our campaigns. Show people Mind's information. This can help them understand more about mental health. You can show them the website or save information as a PDF to print out. Some of our information is available in print format. I just want other carers out there to know they are not alone. Take all the support you can, read the articles on Mind and understand what you, your family and your loved one are dealing with. Your relationship is changing. Mental health problems can affect moods, emotions and behaviours. You may feel as if their personality is changing and they're not the person they used to be. This can affect your relationship. Your relationship might feel unbalanced, or like you only do 'caring' things together. It can help to try and see the mental health problem as something separate from you both. Try to think of it as an external challenge to deal with together. Have a look at our section on the positive side of caring for someone . Managing mental health in a relationship We've set ourselves up as a team, dealing with it together. Read Clare's story They won't get help. They may need support but can't or won't reach out for help. Or they may refuse to accept any help you offer. It's understandable for you to feel frustrated, distressed and powerless if so. Sometimes you might be able to recognise signs they are becoming unwell. You could try and prepare for this by making a list of signs together while they are well. This can make things easier to talk about when you do notice things changing. You may need to decide together how they want you to help if they become unwell again. It's important to acknowledge that there are always limits to the support you can offer. Our page on helping someone seek help explains more about what you can and cannot do. Caring and confidentiality You may feel as if you have the right to know more about their treatment. Not knowing may make you feel excluded or unable to help. The charity Rethink offers useful advice on confidentiality and information sharing . You might also need to consider who is responsible for future arrangements. For details, see our legal information on care planning after leaving hospital and rights of the nearest relative . They push you away or say upsetting things. You might find that they say or do upsetting things sometimes, such as when they're unwell. People tend to take difficult feelings out on those closest to them. They may: push you away but get upset if you leave. find it harder to be patient or get angry more easily. feel convinced that you are somehow a threat to them, an experience of paranoia. It's understandable that you might feel upset and hurt. Try to: remember that they are dealing with difficult moods, emotions or experiences. take some time out if you are finding things too difficult. talk to friends, family or other carers for support. Your mental health is important too. You need to decide how much support you can offer and when to put your own needs first. It's hard to get them the help they need. The mental health system is complicated. It can sometimes be difficult to access the services we need. You may find yourself having to fight for the right support for them. Our information on supporting someone else to seek help may be useful. You may also find it helpful to have a look at our information on advocacy . While I helped him with the day-to-day things he found overwhelming, I also was mentally his carer too. I was combating his negativity every day, trying to cajole him into keeping going. Looking after a young person with a mental health problem. Looking after a young person with a mental health problem can create additional strains and worries. You may: blame yourself for the way they are feeling. feel helpless and frustrated that you can't help them feel better. bear the brunt of their emotions and anger. It's common to think that as a parent you should be able to cope. But you don't need to do this on your own and help is available. Talk to people around you and ask for their help. If you don't have family, friends or a community you can turn to for support, there are other options: Carers UK offer a tool to find out what help is available in your area. We have a hub of information for young people aged 11-18, and information for parents, which may help you to support your young person. YoungMinds has information for parents who are worried about their child, and a Parents Helpline you can contact for free, confidential advice."
"How to look after yourself as a carer. When you spend a lot of your time focusing on someone else, you may feel as if you have no time for yourself. But looking after your own wellbeing is important for you and for them. We have listed some self-care ideas that others have said they find helpful. Even trying one small thing might help you feel more able to cope. On this page: Share how you feel. Try to be realistic. Find ways to stay organised. Support their independence. Find positives in your relationship. Take a break and make time for yourself. Look after your physical health. For general tips about managing your mental health, see our page on how to improve your wellbeing . What to do if you cannot cope. Sometimes the pressure of caring for someone else can build up until it feels like you can no longer cope. This is completely understandable, but may be a sign that you need to try and look after yourself. If you are feeling desperate and in crisis, you won't be able to keep supporting someone else. Try and take a small break. If that's impossible, have a moment to yourself and take some long deep breaths. Knowing that things will get easier in the future can help you feel a little calmer. If you need help or advice for yourself now: You can talk to the Samaritans 24 hours a day on 116 123. To speak in Welsh, call 0808 164 0123. They are there to listen and to help you find a way through. Call the Carers UK helpline from Monday to Friday, 9 am – 6 pm on 0808 808 7777. And use the Carers UK local support search – a tool for finding support in the area you live. Have a look at our info on organisations who can help you and think about who you could contact for support. It might help to make a note of your next steps so you feel more in control. Share how you feel. It's important to have someone to talk to, especially if you're struggling to cope. You could: share your feelings with someone you trust, such as a family member, friend or neighbour. join a support group for carers. contact the Carers UK helpline. talk to others on the Carers UK forum. talk to someone through online mental health tools. Not all of these options may feel right for you. Or you might feel like you have nobody to share your feelings with. If you are feeling isolated or alone, our pages on coping with loneliness offer more information. Try to find someone you can be honest with about your feelings, without judgement. Try to be realistic. If you take too much on, you may feel as if you never achieve anything. Try to get a clear idea about what you can do. By accepting the things that you can't change or do alone, you may feel more able to cope. You could try identifying and writing down: a list of all the support needs of the person you are caring for. what you can do and what you'll need help with. how you'll know when you need a break. Respite is possible – and necessary. You can't give your all as a carer – you just can't. You have to save a bit of yourself just for you. Find ways to stay organised. Staying organised can help you feel more in control. You could keep a schedule or planner of your daily routine. Make sure that you keep all important information and medication in one place. But don't be hard on yourself if you get muddled or things get lost. You've got a lot to think about. If you feel comfortable using technology and have access to a smartphone, you can stay organised digitally. Find out more about carer-specific technology, apps and online services on Carers UK . It may also help to tell someone else where the information is and what to do if you become unwell. This could be a friend, family member or paid worker. Support their independence. It's important to help them have some control over their care. You may find this means taking a step back or supporting decisions that are not what you would do. But it may also mean that you can find a balance in your relationship, and perhaps a little more time for yourself. Work with them to find out: how they can help themselves. what support they need from you. whether there are times that they can cope on their own. After I passed my driving test, I encouraged Mum to take lessons. I knew Mum had driven a car before she became so ill and liked it. It was the best thing she ever did, it gave her some independence. Find positives in your relationship. Looking after someone can change your relationship with them. Sometimes you may feel close and connected. But at other times you may feel angry and irritated. It can help to talk openly and honestly to find ways of coping together. You could try to: consider yourself as their friend, partner or family member first and foremost. talk together about how to strengthen positive parts of your relationship. find common interests or hobbies to do together as well as day-to-day responsibilities. Take a break and make time for yourself. Try and take a break, especially if you're worried about your own mental health. You may not be able to take a break whenever you need one, but it's important to have some time that's yours. You may need an hour or two to clear your head, or a day to help you feel more rested. You could go out, have a nap or turn your phone off for an agreed period of time. Try to make time for things you enjoy. I love running and being able to get out for half an hour each evening allowed me to clear my head and relax. If possible, try and plan regular breaks into your routine. This can allow you to: make plans in advance. give you something to look forward to. make sure the person you look after knows what to expect. The Carers Trust has more information about how you can get help to take a break . Sometimes you may need a longer break, especially if you're worried that you're becoming unwell. Caring for the carers At my lowest, an hour crocheting or playing around with my paints has grounded me and brought me relaxation and calm. Read Maggie's story Look after your physical health. It's important to try and make time to look after your physical health as best you can. Try and eat as healthily as you can and do some kind of regular physical activity.  Try to get enough sleep, as a lack of sleep can make it harder to cope with everyday challenges. It can also make stress and depression worse. For more information, see our pages on sleep and mental health. Use relaxation techniques, as these can help your mind and body feel more rested. You need just a few minutes a day to do most of these exercises. For more information, see our pages on relaxation. I have come up with my own saying, which is 'you have to make your own normal'. Your life changes so much as a carer and you have to make a new life for yourself. You do not want to feel excluded from life, so you make your own normal."
"Where to find support for carers. Seeking help is often the first step towards getting well and staying well. But sometimes it can be hard to know how to start or where you can turn to.

I looked after my friend who was suicidal for weeks, not knowing what to do to help. When I was finally at the end of my tether, I called Samaritans. I didn't realise they were able to help me too.

For information about getting help for specific mental health problems, see our mental health A-Z . Practical help for carers. Social care support.

"About student mental health. Studying is likely to bring a number of changes to your life. It can be enjoyable and interesting, but it can also be challenging. You might face challenges such as: Meeting and working with new people. Exams, presentations or deadlines for written work. Managing your own finances. Coping with homesickness. Balancing the demands of studying with other commitments, such as caring responsibilities or work. Leaving home, finding new housing and living with new people. Maintaining relationships with family and friends, especially if you have moved away from home. When I began university I'd been struggling with my mental health for years but had not got help, and starting university in a new city kick-started my path to diagnosis and recovery. Coping with new challenges can have an impact on your mental health. But there are lots of things that you can do to make your time as a student easier and more enjoyable. Some of the things that might make you more likely to experience a mental health problem as a student are: Stress – becoming a student can be a stressful experience. Although stress isn't a mental health problem, it can lead to mental health problems like depression and anxiety.  Lack of support – you might have left home for the first time, or just don't have enough time to see your friends and family. Not having a good support network can make you vulnerable to developing a mental health problem. You may already be living with an existing mental health problem and be receiving help and support for this. As you start life as a student you may find that your support changes location or you transition from CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) to adult services. It's important to continue your support if needed, become familiar with what this might be and how it will work while you are a student. Learning to cope with anxiety and panic attacks at university. I was sat in a hot, sweaty lecture theatre when suddenly I felt like I needed to escape. Read Sophie's story Common mental health problems for students. The following mental health problems are the most common among students. Our A-Z of mental health has more information about mental health problems, as well as a range of other relevant topics. Anxiety Anxiety disorders are one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health problems among students. Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. Anxiety can become a mental health problem if it impacts on your ability to live your life as fully as you want to.  Depression Depression is another common mental health problem among students. Depression is a type of mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can cause a range of other changes too, and if affects your everyday living.  Suicidal feelings Suicidal feelings can mean having abstract thoughts about ending your life, or feeling that people would be better off without you. Or it can mean thinking about methods of suicide or making clear plans to take your own life.  If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency."
"How can I prepare for student life? This page covers some of the things you may be considering at the start of your student journey: Deciding to become a student. Planning your healthcare. Managing your finances. Managing your studies. Deciding to become a student. There are many decisions to make before your studies begin. These could have an impact on how enjoyable and worthwhile you find your course. You are likely to face decisions such as: what subject to study, what type of course to take, and where? The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) can help you explore some of your options. Going to open days might help you to get a better insight into the subject and what teaching methods the university or college uses. You can also get a feel for the place of study. Open days tend to run throughout the year. It’s worth checking the calendars of a few colleges or universities that you are interested in. You may need to register for a place in advance. Whether to study close to home, to commute or to move somewhere new is another decision that you are likely to face. Check out Student Minds' Transitions guide for some helpful advice on this. It may be that you decide university is not the right option for you. For information on the alternatives that may suit you better, take a look at the Not Going To Uni guide . Planning your healthcare. If you're currently receiving treatment for a mental health problem and you register with a new GP, the support you get may change. Your new GP or Community Mental Health Team (CHMT) may, or may not, do a new assessment. They might advise on a new treatment plan, or they may continue with your current treatment. The NHS has more information about registering with a new GP as a student . To minimise the disruption, it can help to plan early - even as soon as you've chosen a course or accepted a place. Talk to your current GP or CMHT about: The move and what this might mean for your treatment. How your medical notes will be transferred. What they can do to ensure that your new GP understands your medical needs. Reviewing any medication you're taking that may affect your studying. Writing a summary letter about your medical history for your new GP. You might also be considering if, how and when to tell your place of study about your mental health problem. The University Mental Health Advisers Network (UMHAN) is a network of mental health specialists working in higher and further education. Its website has information about telling your place of study and what protection you have. Managing your finances. Studying is likely to affect your personal finances. The money you receive and the way you get it may change. It's important to think about how you will pay for essentials like food, housing and tuition fees. And course costs such as books and other equipment. I try to be sensible with my spending where possible – I always ensure I can afford to eat well and leave enough to treat myself from time to time. The change in financial situation can be particularly difficult if you are a mature student used to earning a full-time wage. Or if you have children or dependents that you support financially. The UK government website has information about extra financial support you may be entitled to. Save the Student also has information about funding available to mature students. If you have a disability A Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) is available to students who have a disability, mental health problem or learning disability. A DSA is a grant that you don’t need to pay back. It can help you cover any extra study-related costs that you may have because of your disability. You need to have been diagnosed by a medical professional and provide proof of this. The UK government website has more information about applying for a DSA. Money worries may feel like more of a challenge if you are a care-leaver or don't have financial support from your family. Take a look at Stand Alone for information about applying for student loans and support from your local authority. UCAS also has information about dedicated funding for care-leavers. Regardless of your situation, it can be useful to create a weekly or termly budget plan. This can help you keep track of your incomings and outgoings. Pick a method that you will find easy to use such as an app or spreadsheet. There are lots of templates online you could use. Check out The Money Charity's Student Money Manual, Money Helper and Save the Student for more advice on managing your finances. You could also take a look at our money and mental health pages. I do part-time university with the Open University, so I have a full-time job alongside. It helps a lot. Managing your studies. You may be returning to education after a break or continuing your studies straight from school or college. Whatever your situation, you may find that you have more responsibility for your own study than you've been used to. This can provide flexibility in how you structure your day, but getting used to planning your own schedule can be a challenge. I try to take a step back and assess my workload, write a list and take it one step at a time. Many colleges and universities run study skills sessions for new students. These can be a great way of learning how to plan and manage your time. They can also help you to understand some of the possible requirements from your new course, such as how to write a research proposal or reference other studies correctly. You could check your university or college's website to see what is available at your place of study. What I wish I’d known sooner is how adaptable university is. There is no right or wrong way to do it – because everyone is different. Read Lizzie's story"
"How can I connect with other students? For some people, studying is a time where they socialise with a wide range of people and have many new experiences. While this can be positive, it can also feel overwhelming. This page covers: Meeting new people. Living with other students. Loneliness. Meeting new people. Being around so many other students creates a great opportunity to meet like-minded people. If you're finding it hard to meet new people, remember many other students will feel the same way. Here are some suggestions to help you get started: Clubs or societies can be a great way to get to know people and create a work-life balance. See what's on offer when you enrol or check in with your Students' Union. Course forums or email groups can keep you connected if you're studying online. Getting to know people online can also make it easier if the course has events like study weekends where you will all meet in person. Volunteering can help you meet people who share an interest with you. There are lots of different ways to get involved: Your college or university’s Students' Union may be able to help you to find volunteering opportunities You could get involved in volunteering or student fundraising for Mind Do IT can help match you with voluntary roles that fit your interests Student Minds runs volunteering programmes you might be interested in The Royal Voluntary Service also has specific opportunities for students, such as volunteering in the NHS. Meeting new people can seem more of a challenge if you feel less like those around you. If you have experienced time in care before studying, you may feel like you have less in common with your classmates. As well as meeting people in the ways described above, it can be useful to connect with groups outside of your place of study. These can help strengthen your support network. For example, the Rees Foundation runs peer network events for care-leavers at all stages of their educational, academic and work lives. If you identify as LGBTQIA+ (meaning you may be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex or asexual) Student Minds has information for LGBTQ+ students. There's advice on starting conversations and what to do if you experience discrimination. Confronting my social anxiety at university. ...I quickly felt lonely, overwhelmed and, at times, quite depressed due to my social skills, or lack thereof. Read Max's story Living with other students. If you've moved away from home, it's likely that at some point you will have to organise your own housing. You may not always feel you have a lot of choice. Especially during the first year when university halls are the main option for most students. But you could think about if you want to live: With people who you can talk to about your mental health. With a smaller number of people, perhaps in a smaller house or block of halls. Closer to campus or somewhere with better transport links. Near shops and amenities such as cafes and sports centres to make it easier to be sociable. Somewhere quiet with more privacy. Renting a house or flat for the first time is a big deal, but there is plenty of advice and support out there. Check whether your university or college offers advice about accommodation, managing landlords and signing contracts. Citizens Advice also has information about student housing. I make plans to see classmates or friends during study breaks to ensure I don't become isolated or lonely. I also make plans each day to leave the house and get outside. Going for a walk is a useful way of relaxing and clearing my head. Loneliness. Lots of students feel lonely. Social media can give the impression that all of your friends are having the best time, all the time. This comparison can make you feel lonelier and loneliness can have a big impact on your mental health. Remember that people usually only post photos of the positive times on social media. This can give a false impression of how great things are. Take a look at the social media accounts or websites of mental health charities. There are some listed in our Useful contacts . Many have platforms to network and share experiences in a safe way. You could try joining a peer support group, either online or in person. Side by Side, is a supportive online space where you can share experiences and listen to others who have similar mental health issues. There might be groups at your institution specifically for students who are experiencing mental health problems. Student Minds runs peer support programmes and mental health campaign groups at universities across the UK. The Mix has an online community, for anyone aged under 25. Remember your peers are often in the same situation . They'll appreciate you talking to them. Even if you're shy, maybe you could: Talk to someone, or just say hello, before and after each lecture or class. Meet classmates in the library to plan a joint piece of work. Chat to people you are living with while making food in a shared kitchen."
"How can I cope with the student lifestyle? Student life can be full of new and exciting experiences. There's often lots going on. It's important to take the time to look after yourself. This will help you to cope with the changes in your lifestyle. Some areas that you could focus on are: Managing stress. Looking after your physical health. Coping in an alcohol or drugs culture. For more ideas, check out Student Minds' Transitions resource . Managing stress. You might feel like there's a lot of pressure to do well academically. And pressure to be sociable. Try to build up strategies to manage stress before it gets too much. This can make it easier to respond to additional pressure – for example, around exam times. Try out some mindfulness exercises. There's lots of evidence to suggest these can be really helpful, especially for managing stress. Take a look at our mindfulness pages for more information. Try using a planner. This can help to keep track of deadlines and key commitments and organise your study. Take time out to relax. Getting away from your desk, even for short periods of time, can help keep you calm. Keep an eye on social commitments to avoid overloading your schedule around deadlines and exams. Try online support and apps. There are lots of apps and websites available that can help you to manage your stress levels. For example, by offering a daily meditation or mindfulness practice. Looking after your physical health. Looking after your physical health can help you stay healthy and maintain concentration to study well. Try to get good sleep If you're tired, things might feel harder to manage. Getting into a regular sleep routine can help you stay on top of university life. Tiredness is one of the biggest problems with the student lifestyle and it can contribute significantly to my mood. I feel more emotional and less capable when I am tired. Eat a healthy diet Eating a balanced and varied diet can help you feel well and think clearly.  You may face additional struggles looking after your diet and exercise if you have eating problems or a diagnosed eating disorder . Read Mary's blog on the Student Minds website. She talks about common misconceptions around eating disorders and how to make the student lifestyle work for you. Exercise regularly Keeping active can help you improve your mental health. Even gentle exercise, like yoga or swimming, can help you relax and manage stress.  Rugby tackling mental health. Rugby was the one thing that always gave me some release from the whirlwind of my mind. Read Laura's story Coping in an alcohol or drugs culture. While alcohol is often associated with the student lifestyle, you don't have to drink if you don't want to. Students' Unions and student-led groups offer a range of social events and activities that are alcohol free. Remember: Alcohol can worsen depression and contribute to other health problems. If you drink, try to make sure you have some days without drinking. Be careful if you are taking medication. Alcohol can interact with some medications and change how they work. Ask your doctor whether this might be an issue with your medication. Having a friend around when you are out can help to keep you safe when you are drinking or if you are using drugs. You could organise a buddy system. Don't accept drinks from someone you don't know. And always keep your drinks with you to help avoid your drink being spiked (with drugs or alcohol). Frank has information about drink spiking and what to do if you think your drink has been spiked. For information on where to get help, see our page on useful contacts for drugs and alcohol support . Recreational drugs can also have a serious impact on your mental health.  Surviving freshers – coping with mental health problems at university. I felt like I was the only one not enjoying myself...

"What if I become unwell while I'm a student? If you become unwell, there are lots of options you can consider. This page covers: Support if you're in crisis. Support on your course. Taking time out from your course. Taking a flexible approach to studying. Thinking about alternatives.  Support if you're in crisis. A crisis is any situation in which you feel you need urgent help. For example, you might feel in crisis if: You're having suicidal thoughts and feelings. You're having thoughts about harming yourself or someone else. You've seriously hurt yourself. Everyone experiences a crisis in their own way. You might feel that your mental health has been steadily getting worse for some time. Or perhaps something's happened in your life that's shaken your stability. You might have a good idea what's likely to trigger a crisis for you. Or you might not know what's causing your feelings. But whatever your situation, if you start to feel unable to cope, or to keep yourself safe, it's important to ask for help. When you begin studying, your university or college might ask you to give details of a trusted person. This might be referred to as a ‘trusted contact’. This is someone they can contact if they’re worried about your mental health. Take a look at our pages on crisis services for information on how to get help in a crisis . If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. My experience of crisis care, depression and speaking out. It was as though the colour had been sucked out of my world. Read Karl's story Support on your course. If you do become unwell, it's important to explain the situation to your academic supervisor, tutor, or a welfare staff member. Do this as soon as possible. If it’s hard to do so, ask someone you trust to do this. Even if you have previously explained that you have a mental health problem, your place of study may not be aware that you're feeling worse. The sooner you let them know, the easier it is for them to help you get support with your academic work. You may be able to have extended deadlines or re-sit exams. Take time out from your course. Each course is different in its approach to taking time off from studying. It may be possible to defer the course for a time. Or you could possibly repeat a term or a year. Your university or college may need a letter from your doctor to explain how your mental health is affecting your studies. The process can sometimes be daunting. Having support from a friend of family member can help during this time. A few weeks after starting uni, I realised that my course wasn't right for me. I hated the city, felt like a failure and struggled with my mental health. I decided to drop out and transfer to a different one. When I started at the right uni and course everything changed. My mental health improved, I made friends, and now I'm in a career linked to the degree I loved. Take a look at Andrew's blog on the Student Minds website . You can hear what he learnt from taking leave from his studies. Taking a flexible approach to studying. Your university might be able to make adjustments to how you study. For example, you may be able to: Complete your degree part-time. Have longer deadlines for coursework. Get more time in exams. There are also informal adjustments it can make to support you to stay well. For example, you could ask that meetings are at a particular time of day when your energy levels are at their highest. Or that meetings take place in a location where you feel most able to concentrate. The Student Minds blog has more examples of adjustments other students have found useful. It may help to start by thinking about what you would need to make it easier to continue your studies. Who can I talk to about my options? It may be helpful to have a chat with someone impartial about your options. Even if it's just to get it clear in your own mind about what you think would help. You could talk to your academic supervisor or tutor. They should be able to explain your university or college's policy for taking time out. You could also talk to them about how you could take a more flexible approach to your studies. Your university or college's disability service can also support you around taking time out or taking a different approach to your studies. Your Students' Union advice service or welfare office can also give you impartial advice. Thinking about alternatives. You might feel that continuing your course isn't right for you, and that's okay. It could be useful to think about some alternatives such as: Trying a different course or location. Studying a vocational course or apprenticeship. Taking a gap year. Starting work or re-starting work. Not Going To Uni has advice and information about alternatives to university. If you find yourself in a situation where you have to choose between university and your mental health treatment, my advice would be to choose mental health treatment. It's more important. You can always pick up where you left off with studying, but you can't really do that with your health because the longer you leave it, the harder it becomes to treat."
"What mental health support can I get while studying? There are many different individuals and organisations who can offer you mental health support. If possible, put this support in place when things are going well. It could make it easier to ask for help if you start to find things more difficult. Try thinking about who you feel comfortable talking to. You might want support from: Your place of study. Outside of your place of study. Friends and family. Online mental health support. Whether you have an existing mental health problem or are starting to find things difficult to manage, considering your options for support can be helpful. Support can vary, both in quality and how easy it is to access. So it can be useful to consider a variety of places and people that you can seek support from. However difficult it may feel, it is important to be open with your university if you are suffering with mental health problems. You will be unable to receive the support you need and that is available without doing so. Support from your place of study. The college or university disability service Your college or university may have a disability support service. The service can support you to manage any health problem that affects your studies. This includes both physical and mental health problems. You can arrange a meeting with the disability service to discuss any challenges that you might have with your studies. And look at what support the service can provide. The service may be able to arrange: Mentoring – this might be with another student or a disability specialist. Study skills training – such as courses in coping with stress or planning work. Specific arrangements – for your assessments or exams. You may also be eligible for financial support through the Disabled Students' Allowance . The University Mental Health Advisers Network (UMHAN) is a good source of information about the support you could be entitled to. Your college or university counselling service Most colleges and universities have a free counselling service for students. The service can can offer you advice about your circumstances. This is independent of your academic tutors or your GP. You can usually self-refer to a university or college counselling service. You don't need to see your GP first or have a medical diagnosis. I would say that none of the places I went to, whether that was the wellbeing team, the support service for Psychology, or my GP, immediately changed my mental health as soon as I left the building. Read this student's story Student led support Your place of study may have a Students' Union with a welfare officer or a Student Advice Service. They can offer free and independent advice or support. They can also refer you to external support. Students' Unions and the staff they employ are independent of the university or college. But they are usually based in the same buildings. An academic contact Your university or college should assign you an academic supervisor or tutor. They should give you support and advice about your studies. If your tutor knows about your mental health, they may be able to better support you and help you to get further academic support. Some tutors will be proactive about meeting their students. With others, you may have to contact them to arrange a meeting. Remember, they are there to support you, so don't feel shy about taking the first step. Talking to your tutor early can help ensure that the right support is in place. So if things do get tricky, they'll understand how they can support you. Your department may have a welfare or disability liaison. You could talk to them about your mental health, if you don't feel comfortable talking to your tutor. Each place of study will offer slightly different support. It's always worth taking a look at your university or college's website to see what is available to you. If your place of study is in England or Wales, you can use the support service finder from Student Space. Find out if you can access services such as: Mental health and counselling support teams. Student advice services. Support networks. Visit Student Space to use the support finder tool . The tutors who I chose to open up to were supportive. As a result of asking for help I realised that with a few adjustments I would be able to finish my course, and nobody thought any less of me. Support outside your place of study. Your GP Your GP can support you by: Referring you to local services. Prescribing medication where necessary. Helping you get treatment for your mental health. If you don't have a diagnosis, but are concerned about your mental health, you can always speak to your GP about this.  You can also find more advice from the NHS on student health. If you are an international student , you might not be familiar with the National Health Service (NHS) and how to get support. The UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) has some useful information on looking after yourself and how to get medical treatment if you need it. I found having someone in healthcare validate how I was feeling extremely positive. Knowing that what I was experiencing wasn't just normal sadness, but that it also had a name, helped me understand myself and support myself better for the rest of the term. Organisations and charities There are some charities and organisations who specifically work with students. They could offer you support: Student Minds offers support for students and runs peer support groups across the country. Students against depression has information and advice for students experiencing depression. Nightline offers confidential telephone support overnight at universities across the country. Young Minds has information and support for young people experiencing mental health problems. Propel gives support, help and advice to young care leavers around moving into higher education. Voluntary organisations and charities also give support to students. Citizens Advice – gives support on practical issues like housing, debt and benefits. The Samaritans – available 24 hours a day by telephone or email, to talk about anything that's upsetting you. Local Minds – offer a range of support services in local areas. Get in touch with one to find out more. The Mix - supports anyone aged under 25 with issues including mental health, housing and going through a break up. It has a crisis messenger service, a counselling service, and an online community. Peer support When you experience a mental health problem it can feel as if no one understands. Peer support brings together people who've had similar experiences to support each other. Many students find that meeting others with experience of mental health difficulties helps them feel less alone. And it makes it easier to talk about their own mental health. Your place of study might run peer support groups on campus, in your halls or on your course. You can usually self-refer to peer support programmes. You don't need to see a GP first or have a diagnosis. You can also get online peer support through communities like Side by Side. Our pages on looking after your mental health online have information which may help if you get support online. Check out your college or university's counselling service, Students' Union or Student Minds peer support programmes for more information about peer support near you. Friends and family. University friends and housemates If your friends or housemates have been worried about how you're doing, talking to them might be a relief for all of you. If you're worried about how they'll react, talk to them about this. They may appreciate your advice on how they can help and what they can to do to be supportive. Student Minds provides advice and support for students supporting friends . I have bipolar disorder, and when I experience manic episodes it can be difficult for people to understand what I am experiencing. For me, it was very important to let my friends know how they expressed themselves, what it meant for me, and what they could do to support me day-to-day or in crisis. Friends or family back home If you've moved away from home, it can be difficult to keep in contact with friends and family, particularly if you're an international student. Even if you haven't moved, you may not spend as much time with your family and friends as you used to. You may have less time than before or be making new friends. Or you may want to be more independent while studying. However it can be useful to get support from old friends and your family. Particularly if you're feeling low or experiencing poor mental health. To keep in contact while also having an independent or new lifestyle, try: Using email or social media – even quick forms of contact, like forwarding jokes, allow you to keep in touch. Writing a letter or card – these can feel more personal and be nice to receive. Taking time to talk – set aside a time each week to chat to a close friend or family. Inviting friends to stay so you can show them around – they may then do the same for you. Keeping people up to date with what you're doing – so they feel they're still part of your life – you don't have to tell them everything, just let them know what's going on. Online mental health support. Being online can be beneficial to your mental health, but it also has some challenges. Visit our pages on looking after your mental health online for more information. Plus tips on getting the balance right between your online and offline life. Student Space Student Space is a website set up by the charity Student Minds .

"What happens when I finish my course? Preparing for graduation and moving on after studying can be both exciting and daunting. You may be thinking about your future career or about the support you will want after completing your course. It's a good idea to think about the steps you can take to help you manage the move out of studying and look after your mental health. This page covers: Preparing for life after your course. Maintaining your support network. Arranging your healthcare. Transitioning into working life. Save the Student also has a helpful list of things to consider as you prepare to leave university. Preparing for life after your course. It's completely normal to have no idea what you want to do after your course finishes. This can feel stressful or affect how you feel about yourself. But it's important to remember that many people take months or even years to work out their next steps. How do I decide what to do next? If you're studying a course that could lead onto a specific career, relevant societies will have information about career options in your field. Make use of your university or college careers service. This is a great place to help you start thinking about what you might like to do when you finish studying. The National Careers Service (England) or Careers Wales and UCAS have advice and information on planning a career. Maintaining your support network. When you graduate, it's likely that the support networks you have may no longer be as easily available. If you're moving away from the place where you studied, it might be worth thinking about the support that's available in the new place where you'll be living. Stay in touch with course mates – everyone finds this transition tricky, and hearing from an old friend can be reassuring. Try online support – you can access this wherever you move to.  Speak your local Mind to find out more about the support in your new area. Arranging your healthcare. If you're moving away from where you have been studying, you'll need to plan how the move might affect any support you currently receive. This could be from your GP or an NHS service. Visit your current GP and think about the process of transferring your care to a new GP. Find out where you can register with a new GP. If you're in touch with your community mental health team (CMHT) or crisis team, let them know that you're moving. Find out how you can access the support you want in your new home. Transitioning into working life. If you're starting work or returning to a job after your course, it's important to think about how you'll manage your mental health in this new environment. Read our information about talking to your manager about your mental health.  Work, just like studying can take different forms.

"How can someone else help? This section is for friends and family who want to help someone they know with a mental health problem who is studying or considering becoming a student. When a friend or family member becomes a student, it can bring lots of changes to their life. There are things you can do to help them manage these changes. Keep in touch – make the effort to stay in contact. Even if they appear very busy, they are likely to appreciate the effort. Make time to be together – if they've moved away, visit them where they are studying. This can give you the opportunity to understand more about their new life. But accept that for some, student life can be busy. So be patient and flexible to find dates that work. Ask them how they are doing – it doesn't have to be a serious conversation about mental health, but most people will appreciate being asked. If you're worried about how they're doing, creating time and space for an honest answer can help. This could be while going for a walk, doing a joint activity such as crafting or even washing up. From the second my parents found out about my illness, everything was about supporting me but also trying to get things back to normal for me, and never about holding me back. They gave me endless support. Take an interest – ask them about what they're working on at the moment or about their course. Give them space – if they've left home for the first time, remember that being a student is part of a process of gaining independence and growing up. It's natural that they may not want to tell you everything. Offer practical help, especially if you're nearby – for example, help with a routine task, such as preparing or cooking food. Help them to make the transition between healthcare services at home and university, and encourage them to access the support available to them. Remember that studying can feel like a job – while they may not be going to a full time job, studying can take up a lot of time. It can involve long hours in lectures or busy work placements. Try to understand that they can feel under a lot of pressure, and offer them support. Understand that student life isn't a walk in the park for everyone and it isn't necessarily the 'time of your life'. Look after yourself. Supporting someone else can have an impact on your own mental health. For more information see: Our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else. Student Minds' resource Look After Your Mate.
